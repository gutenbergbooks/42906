<p class="sbt1">THE &ldquo;EVENING MOON&rdquo; CONCLUDES ITS NARRATIVE,
AND AFFORDS A FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE
CHILD-LIKE AND VOLATILE CHARACTER OF LYDIA
HOLDFAST.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the hope of her husband&rsquo;s return, and looking
forward with sweet mysterious delight
to the moment when she would hold her baby
to her breast, Mrs. Holdfast was a perfectly
happy woman&mdash;a being to be envied. She
had some cause for anxiety in the circumstance
that she did not hear from her husband, but
she consoled herself with the reflection that
his last letter to her afforded a sufficient
explanation of his silence. She mentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
followed his movements as the days passed by.
Some little time would be occupied in settling
his son&rsquo;s affairs; the young man most likely
died in debt. Mr. Holdfast would not rest
satisfied until he had ascertained the exact
extent of his unhappy son&rsquo;s liabilities, and had
discharged them. With Frederick&rsquo;s death
must be cleared away the dishonour of
his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that he was dead,&rdquo; said the widow,
&ldquo;I was ready to pity and forgive him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her baby was born, and her husband had
not returned. Day after day she looked for
news of him, until she worked herself into a
fever of anxiety. The result was that she
became ill, and was ordered into the country
for fresher air. But she could not rest. Her
husband&rsquo;s return appeared to be delayed
beyond reasonable limits. Could anything
have happened to him in the wild part of the
world in which Frederick had met his death?
She did not dream that in the tragedy which
had occurred in the very heart of London, the
murder in Great Porter Square, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
all the country was ringing, lay the answer to
her fears. In her delicate state of health she
avoided the excitement of the newspapers, and
for weeks did not look at one. Thus, when
her health was to some extent established, and
she had returned to her house in London, she
had no knowledge of the murder, and was in
ignorance of the few particulars relating to it
which the police had been enabled to bring to
light. She knew nothing of the arrest of
Antony Cowlrick, of the frequent adjournments
at the police-court, and of the subsequent
release of this man whose movements have
been enveloped in so much mystery.</p>

<p>It happened during her illness that a friend,
who witnessed the anxiety of her mind and
sympathised with her, wrote to America for
information concerning Mr. Holdfast, anticipating
that the reply to his letter would
enable him to communicate good news to her;
and it also happened, most singularly, after a
lapse of time, that it was to this very friend
Mrs. Holdfast appealed for advice as to how
she should act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt as if I was going mad,&rdquo; are the
widow&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I could endure the terrible
suspense no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She called upon her friend, not being aware
that he had written to America on her behalf.
On the table was a letter with the American
post-mark on the envelope, and as her friend,
in a hurried manner, rose to receive her, she
observed that he placed his hand upon this
letter, as though wishing to conceal it from her
sight. But her quick eyes had already
detected it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she said, after she had
explained the motive of her visit, &ldquo;that you
had correspondence with America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at his hand, which still covered
the letter, and his face became troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is in answer to a special
letter I sent to the States concerning Mr.
Holdfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;then I am interested
in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you are interested
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Her suspicions were aroused. &ldquo;Is that
the reason,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;why you seek to
hide it from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;increase your
anxiety. Can you bear a great shock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;anything,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;rather
than this terrible torture of silence and
mystery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote to America,&rdquo; then said her friend,
&ldquo;to an agent, requesting him to ascertain
how and where your husband was. An hour
before you entered the room I received his
answer. It is here. It will be best to hide
nothing from you. I will read what my
correspondent says.&rdquo; He opened the letter,
and read: &ldquo;I have made inquiries after Mr.
Holdfast, and am informed, upon undoubted
authority, that he left America for England
some weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s friend read this extract
without comment, but Mrs. Holdfast did not
appear to realize the true import of the
information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not understand?&rdquo; asked her friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mr. Holdfast, some weeks ago, left America
for England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the bewildered woman;
&ldquo;if he were here&mdash;in England&mdash;I should not
be with you at this moment, asking you to
assist me to find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her friend was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Do you think
he is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain that he has left America,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>

<p>A new fear assailed her. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;the ship he sailed in was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not probable,&rdquo; said her friend.
&ldquo;Mr. Holdfast, as a man of the world and a
gentleman of means, undoubtedly took passage
in a fast steamer. In all human probability
your husband landed at Liverpool within
nine or ten days of his departure from New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can say what happened to him them?
It is, of course, certain that his desire was to
come to you without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He would not have lingered an hour,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Holdfast. &ldquo;An hour! He would
not have lingered a moment. He would be
only too eager, too anxious, to rejoin me.
And there was another motive for his impatience&mdash;his
child, whose face he has never
seen, whose lips he has never kissed! Unhappy
woman that I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her friend waited until she had somewhat
mastered her grief, and then he asked her a
question which opened up another channel
for fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your husband in the habit of carrying
much money about with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large sum; always a large sum. He
often had as much as a thousand pounds in
notes in his pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was injudicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was most careless in money matters,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Holdfast; &ldquo;he would open his
pocket-book in the presence of strangers, recklessly
and without thought. More than once
I have said to him that I should not wonder
if he was robbed of it one day. But even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that case&mdash;suppose he <em>had</em> incited some
wretch&rsquo;s cupidity; suppose he <em>was</em> robbed&mdash;it
would not have prevented him from
hastening to me and his child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not imagine,&rdquo; said her friend, &ldquo;that in
what I am about to say I desire to add to your
difficulties and distress of mind. The length
of time since you have heard from your husband&mdash;the
fact that he left America and
landed in England&mdash;make the case alarming.
Your husband is not a man who would calmly
submit to an outrage. Were an attempt made
to rob him he would resist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed he would&mdash;at the hazard of his
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have put into words the fear which
assails me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdfast, clinging to every
argument against the horrible suspicion now
engendered, &ldquo;had anything of the kind happened,
it would have been in the newspapers,
and would have been brought to my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are such things,&rdquo; said her friend,
impressively, &ldquo;as mysterious disappearances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Men have been robbed and murdered, and
never more heard of. Men have left their
homes, in the midst of crowded cities, intending
to return within an hour, and have disappeared
for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is easier to imagine than to describe the
state of Mrs. Holdfast&rsquo;s mind at these words.
They seemed, as she expressed it, &ldquo;to drain
her heart of hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo; she
asked, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To go at once to a lawyer,&rdquo; was the sensible
answer, &ldquo;and place the matter in his
hands. Not an hour is to be lost; and the
lawyer you consult should be one who is
familiar with criminal cases. I have the
address of such a gentleman, and I should
recommend you to drive to his office immediately,
and lay the whole case before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast took the advice given to her,
and drove at once to the lawyer who was
recommended to her. He listened to her
story, and allowed her to tell it in her own
way without interruption; and when she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
finished, he put a variety of questions to her,
many of which appeared to her trivial and
unnecessary. Before she left the office the
lawyer said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your husband is in England, we will
find him for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this small modicum of comfort she
was fain to be satisfied; but as she rode home
she shuddered to think that she had seen on
the lawyer&rsquo;s lips the unspoken words, &ldquo;dead
or alive.&rdquo; That is what the lawyer meant to
express: &ldquo;If your husband is in England, we
will find him for you, dead or alive.&rdquo; Another
of his actions haunted her. At a certain
point of the conversation, the lawyer had
paused, and upon a separate sheet of paper
had made the following memorandum&mdash;&ldquo;Look
up the murders. How about the murder in
Great Porter Square?&rdquo; She was curious to
see what it was he had written with so serious
an air, and she rose and looked at the paper,
and read the words. How dreadful they
were! &ldquo;Look up the murders. How about
the murder in Great Porter Square?&rdquo; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
appalling significance of the memorandum
filled her with terrible forbodings.</p>

<p>But what were the particulars of the murder
in Great Porter Square, of which till now she
had never heard, and what possible relation
could they bear to her? She could not wait
for the lawyer; she had placed the matter in
his hands, but the issue at stake was too
grave for her to sit idly down and make no
effort herself to reach the heart of the mystery.
That very evening she ascertained that in a
certain house, No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter Square,
a cruel murder had been committed, and that
the murdered man had not been identified.
On the date of this murder she was in the
country, endeavouring by quietude to regain
her health and peace of mind; her baby at that
time was nearly two months old, and for
weeks before the date and for weeks afterwards
she had not read a newspaper. Now
that she learned that the murder might, even
by the barest possibility, afford a clue to the
mystery in which she was involved, she felt as
if it would be criminal in her to sleep until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she had made herself fully acquainted with all
the details of the dreadful deed. She went
from shop to shop, and purchased a number
of newspapers containing accounts of the discovery
of the murder, and of the accusation
brought against Antony Cowlrick. When
the lawyer called upon her the following
morning he found her deeply engaged in the
study of these papers. He made no remark,
divining the motive for this painful duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not closed my eyes all night,&rdquo; she
said to him plaintively. &ldquo;Where is Great
Porter Square?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is not
necessary for you to know the locality of this
terrible crime. It will not help you to go
there. Remain quiet, and leave the matter
with me. I have already done something
towards the clearing-up of the mystery. Do
not agitate yourself needlessly; you will require
all your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then asked her if she had a portrait of
her husband. She had a photograph, taken
at her request the day before their marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holdfast was above these small
vanities,&rdquo; she said, and suddenly checked herself,
crying, &ldquo;Good God! What did I say?
<em>Was</em> above them! <em>Is</em> above them, I mean.
He cannot be dead&mdash;he cannot, he cannot be
dead! I had to persuade him to have the
picture taken. It is here&mdash;in this locket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave her lawyer the locket, and he departed
with it. When he called upon her
again in the evening, his manner was very
grave and sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your husband make a will?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and gave it me in a
sealed envelope. I have it upstairs, in a
safe, in which I keep my jewels. It is dated
on the day on which he forbade his son
Frederick ever again to enter his house.
Would you like to see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be as well,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;for
you to place it in my care. I shall not break
the seal until the present inquiry is terminated.
It will be very soon&mdash;very soon. Are you
strong enough to hear some bad news, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
will you wait till to-morrow? Yes, yes&mdash;it
will be better to wait till to-morrow. A good
night&rsquo;s rest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She interrupted him impetuously. It would
be death to her to wait, she declared, and she
implored him to tell her the worst at once.
Reluctant as he was, he saw that it would be
the wisest course, and he told her, as tenderly
and considerately as he could, that the portrait
she had given him exactly resembled the
description of the man who was found murdered
in Great Porter Square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shall
obtain the order to exhume the body. A
most harrowing and painful task awaits you.
It will be necessary for you to attend and
state, to the best of your belief, whether the
body is that of your lost husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our readers will guess how this painful
inquiry terminated. Mr. Holdfast bore upon
his person certain marks which rendered
identification an easy task; a scar on his left
wrist, which in his youth had been cut to the
bone; a broken tooth, and other signs, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
placed beyond the shadow of a doubt the fact
that he is the man who took a room on the
first floor of No.&nbsp;119 Great Porter Square,
and was there ruthlessly and strangely murdered
on the night of the 10th of July. So
far, therefore, the mystery is cleared up.</p>

<p>But the identification of the body of the
murdered man as that of a gentleman of great
wealth, with a charming wife, and shortly
after the strange death of his son Frederick,
who was the only person whose life was likely
to mar his happiness&mdash;the facts that this gentleman
arrived in London, and did not return
immediately to his home; that he proceeded,
instead, to a common Square in a poor neighbourhood,
and engaged a room without giving
his name; that during the few days he lived
there he received only one visitor, a lady
who came and went closely veiled&mdash;these
facts have added new and interesting elements
of mystery to the shocking affair. Whether
they will assist in bringing the murderer to
justice remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast has been and is most frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and open in her communications to our
Reporter, who, it will be presently seen, has
not confined his inquiries to this lady alone.
In other circumstances it would have been
natural, on the part of Mrs. Holdfast, that she
should have been less communicative on the
subject of the domestic trouble between
herself and Mr. Holdfast and his son; but as
she justly observed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps by and bye something may occur
which will render it necessary that I shall be
examined. The murderer may be discovered&mdash;I
shall pray, day and night, that he or she
may be arrested! In that case, I should have
to appear as a witness, and should have to tell
all I know. Then I might be asked why I
concealed all these unhappy differences between
father and son. I should not know how
to answer. No; I will conceal nothing; then
they can&rsquo;t blame me. And if it will only help,
in the smallest way, to discover the wretch
who has killed the noblest gentleman that ever
lived, I shall be more than ever satisfied that
I have done what is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>We yield to this lady our fullest admiration
for the courageous course she has pursued.
She has not studied her own feelings; she has
laid bare a story of domestic trouble and
treachery as strange as the most ingenious
drama on the French stage could present&mdash;such
a story as Sardou or Octave Feulliet
would revel in; and, without hesitation, she
has thrown aside all reserve, in the light of
the great duty which is before her, the duty
of doing everything in her power to hunt the
murderer down, and avenge her husband&rsquo;s
death. It is not many who would have the
moral courage thus to expose their wounds to
public gaze, and we are satisfied that our
narrative will have the effect of causing a wide
and general sympathy to be expressed for this
most unfortunate lady.</p>

<p>We now come to other considerations of the
affair. The gentleman who was murdered was
a gentleman of wealth and position in society.
He loved his wife; between them there had
never been the slightest difference; they were
in complete accord in their views of the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the unhappy young man at whose
door, indirectly, the primary guilt of the
tragedy may be laid. The reason why Mr.
Holdfast did not write to his wife for so long
a period is partly explained by the account he
gives, in his last letter to her, of the injury he
received in his right hand. We say partly,
because, a little further on, our readers will
perceive that this reason will not hold good up
to the day of his death. Most positively it
may be accepted that the deepest and strongest
motives existed for his endeavour to keep the
circumstance of his being in London from the
knowledge of his wife. Could these motives
be discovered&mdash;could any light be thrown
upon them&mdash;a distinct point would be established
from which the murderer might be
tracked. Our Reporter put several questions
to Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it an absolute certainty that Frederick
Holdfast is dead?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She gazed at him in wonderment. &ldquo;Who
can doubt it?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There is my
husband&rsquo;s letter, saying he had traced his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to Minnesota, and was journeying after him.
There is the account in the newspaper of the
death of the misguided young man in a small
town in Minnesota. The editor of the newspaper,
knowing nothing whatever of any of
us, could scarcely have invented such a paragraph&mdash;though
we know they <em>do</em> put strange
things in the American papers; but this,
unhappily, is too near the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said our Reporter, &ldquo;the presumption
would be a wild one&mdash;but it is
possible; and I seldom shut my mind to a
possibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast was very agitated. &ldquo;It is <em>not</em>
possible&mdash;it is <em>not</em> possible!&rdquo; she cried, repeating
the asseveration with vehemence. &ldquo;It
would be too horrible to contemplate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would be too horrible to contemplate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he followed his father to London&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused, overcome by emotion. Our
Reporter took up the cue. &ldquo;And murdered
him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the lovely widow, in a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tone, &ldquo;and murdered him! I would not
believe it&mdash;no, I would not believe it! Bad
and wicked as he is, he <em>could</em> not be guilty of
a crime so horrible. And, after all, it was
partly my fault. Why did I not grow up into
the likeness of an ugly old witch&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused again, and smiled. There is in
this lovely lady so much animation and vitality,
so much pure love of life, so much sunlight,
that they overcome her against her will, and
break out in the midst of the gloomiest fits of
melancholy and depression. Hers is a happy,
joyous, and impulsive nature, and the blow
that has fallen upon her is all the more cruel
because of her innate brightness and gaiety of
disposition. But it is merciful, also, that she
is thus gifted. She might not otherwise have
sufficient strength to bear up against her
affliction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will, then,&rdquo; said our Reporter, &ldquo;dismiss
the possibility&mdash;which I confess is scarcely to
be indulged in even by such a man as myself.
As to your being beautiful, a rose might as
reasonably complain that nature had invested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it with grace of form and loveliness of colour.&rdquo;
Mrs. Holdfast blushed at this compliment.
&ldquo;You are right in saying that such an idea as
Frederick Holdfast being alive is too horrible
to contemplate. The American newspaper
says that his body was identified by a gentleman
who knew him in Oxford, and who happened
to be travelling through the State of
Minnesota. It is a strange coincidence&mdash;nothing
more&mdash;that on the precise day on
which Frederick Holdfast ended his career, a
friend should have been travelling in that
distant State, and should have given a name to
the dead stranger who was found near the
laughing waters of Minnie-ha-ha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast replied with a sweet smile.
&ldquo;Yes, it is a strange coincidence; but young
gentlemen now-a-days have numbers of
acquaintances, hundreds I should say. And
everybody travels now&mdash;people think nothing
of going to America or Canada. It is just
packing up their Gladstone bag, and off they
go, as happy as you please. <em>I</em> couldn&rsquo;t do it.
I <em>hate</em> the sea; I hate everything that makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me uncomfortable. I love pleasure. Strange,
isn&rsquo;t it, for me, a country girl, to be so fond
of life and gaiety, and dancing and theatres?
But we can&rsquo;t help our natures, can we? I
would if I could, for you must think me a
dreadful, dreadful creature for talking in this
way just after my husband has been brutally
killed! Don&rsquo;t think ill of me&mdash;don&rsquo;t! It is
not my fault, and I am suffering dreadfully,
dreadfully, though I <em>do</em> let my light heart
run away with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I think ill of you?&rdquo; said our
Reporter; &ldquo;you are child and woman in
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; she cried, looking up into his
face with a beaming smile. &ldquo;Are you really,
really in earnest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may believe me,&rdquo; replied our
Reporter, &ldquo;for my errand here is not a
personal one, but in pursuance of my professional
duties; and although you charm me
out of myself, I must be faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holdfast, &ldquo;that is the way
of you men. So stern, and strict, and proper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that you never forget yourself. It is because
you are strong, and wise&mdash;but you miss a
great deal&mdash;yes, indeed, indeed you do! It
would spoil the sunshine if one stopped while
one was enjoying the light and warmth, to
ask why, and what, and wherefore. Don&rsquo;t
you think it would? Such a volatile, impressionable
creature as Lydia Holdfast does
not stop to do such a wise and foolish thing&mdash;we
can be both wise and foolish in a
breath, let me tell you. No; I enjoy, and
am happy, without wanting to know why.
There! I am showing myself to you, as if
you were my oldest friend. <em>You</em> would not
do the same by me. You are steadier, and
wiser, and not half so happy&mdash;no, not half,
not half so happy! O, I wish I had been
born a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amused, and, as he had declared to her,
charmed out of himself, our Reporter said,
somewhat jocosely,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what would you have done if you
had been born a man instead of a woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said, in a half-whisper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and with her finger on her lips, as though
enjoining him not to betray her, &ldquo;I am afraid
I should have been a dreadful rake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our Reporter resisted the beguilement of
the current into which the conversation had
drifted, although he would have been entitled
to much excuse had he dallied a little in this
vein with the charming and child-like
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget your child,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;had
you been born a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he could complete the sentence,
Mrs. Holdfast rushed out of the room, and in
a few moments returned with the child in her
arms. She sat in a rocking chair, and
fondled the boy-baby, and kissed him, and
sang to him. It was a picture of perfect and
beautiful motherhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget my child!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Forget my baby! You must either be mad
or insincere to say such a thing. Ask the
darling&rsquo;s forgiveness immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said our Reporter, kissing the
baby, &ldquo;and yours. You have proved yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a true woman. But my time is getting short,
and I have already trespassed too long upon
yours. Let us continue the conversation
about Mr. Holdfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She instantly became serious, and with the
baby in her arms, said, &ldquo;Yes! Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The landlady of the house,&rdquo; continued
our Reporter, &ldquo;in which he lodged has
declared that he had but one visitor&mdash;a lady,
closely veiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have read in the papers,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Holdfast. &ldquo;Is nothing known about her&mdash;where
she came from, where she went to,
whether she was a lady or a common
woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is known,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, as far as my information goes.
One person says that she was tall, another
that she was short; another that she was
fair, another that she was dark&mdash;though they
all agree that she never raised her veil.
There is absolutely not a dependable clue
upon which a person can work; nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
reliable can be gathered from statements so
conflicting. What I wish to know is, whether
you yourself have any suspicion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flushed with indignation. &ldquo;You do
not mean to ask me whether Mr. Holdfast
was enamoured of a woman with whom he
made secret assignations? You insult me.
I thought better of you; I did not believe
you capable of harbouring such a suspicion
against the dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake me,&rdquo; said our Reporter;
&ldquo;no such suspicion was in my mind. My
thoughts were travelling in a different direction,
and I was curious to ascertain whether
what has occurred to my mind has occurred
to yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this woman?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, about this woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to speak of it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Holdfast, after a pause, and speaking with
evident reluctance; &ldquo;it is the one thing in
this dreadful affair I desired to keep to myself.
I had a motive&mdash;yes; I did not want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to do anyone an injustice. But, what can a
weak woman like myself do when she is in the
company of such a man as you? Nothing
escapes you. It seems to me as if you had
studied every little incident in connection with
the murder of my poor husband for the purpose
of bringing some one in guilty; but you
are better acquainted than I am with the
wickedness of people. You want to know
what reason my husband had in taking a common
lodging in Great Porter Square instead
of coming home at once to me and his child.
In my weak way I have thought it out.
Shall I tell you how I have worked it out in
my mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Above everything else in the world,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Holdfast, looking tenderly at her baby
lying in her lap, &ldquo;even above his love for me,
Mr. Holdfast valued the honour of his name.
There is nothing he would not have sacrificed
to preserve that unsullied. Well, then, after
his son&rsquo;s death he discovered something&mdash;who
can say what?&mdash;which touched his honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and which needed skilful management to
avoid public disgrace. I can think of nothing
else than that the woman, who was connected
in a disgraceful way with his son, had some
sort of power over my poor husband, and that
he wished to purchase her silence before he
presented himself to me and our baby. He
came home, and took the lodgings in Great
Porter Square. There this woman visited him,
and there he met his death. That is all I can
think of. If I try to get any further, my
mind gets into a whirl. Now you know all;
I have concealed nothing from you. It is my
firm belief that when you discover this woman
everything else will be discovered. But you
will never discover her&mdash;never, never! And
my poor husband&rsquo;s death will never be
avenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ask you but one more question,&rdquo;
said our Reporter. &ldquo;In what way do you
account for the circumstance of your husband
not writing to you after his return to
London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you forget,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Holdfast, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
return, &ldquo;that he had injured his hand, and
that he did not wish to disclose his private
affairs to a stranger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the interview terminated; and here,
with the exception of the statement of three
facts, our narrative ends.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast is mistaken in her belief that
her husband did not write to her because he
had injured his hand, and was unwilling to
employ an amanuensis. Our Reporter, after
he left Mrs. Holdfast, had an interview with
the former landlady of 119 Great Porter
Square, who has left the house, and would
under no consideration return to it. The
landlady states that, on three occasions, she
entered Mr. Holdfast&rsquo;s room when he was in
it, and that on every occasion he was writing,
and apparently writing freely. It did not
appear to her that his hand was injured in the
slightest degree. There was no bandage or
plaister upon it, and he did not complain. We
are in a position also to declare that, at the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> examination, no recent injury of
the right hand was perceptible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of Mr. Holdfast&rsquo;s property has
been left by him, in a properly attested will,
to his widow. When he made this will his
son Frederick was alive. Not a shilling, however,
is left to the son.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holdfast has offered a reward of five
hundred pounds for the discovery of the
murderer of her husband.</p>

<p>We have no doubt our readers will appreciate
our enterprise in presenting them with
this circumstantial account of the latest phase
of the Great Porter Square Mystery.</p>

<p>The question that now remains to be
answered is&mdash;Where is Mr. Holdfast&rsquo;s son?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">RICHARD MANX MAKES LOVE TO &ldquo;SWEET BECKY.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">On</span> the morning following the publication of
the Supplement to the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>,
Becky had occasion to observe that her
mistress, Mrs. Preedy, was earnestly engaged
in the perusal of a newspaper. A great deal
of house-work had to be done on this morning;
there was a general &ldquo;cleaning-up;&rdquo;
floors and stairs to be scrubbed, chairs and
tables to be polished, and looking-glasses and
windows to be cleaned; and as the greater
portion of this work fell to Becky&rsquo;s share, she
was kept busily employed until the afternoon.
She was, therefore, in ignorance of the publication
of the statement in the <cite>Evening
Moon</cite>, and her curiosity was but languidly
aroused by Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s pre-occupation,
until, by mere chance, she caught sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the heading, &ldquo;The Murder in Great Porter
Square.&rdquo; She turned hot and cold, and her
pulses quickened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that something fresh about the murder
next door?&rdquo; she ventured to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Becky,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Preedy, but did
not offer any explanation of the contents.</p>

<p>It was not Becky&rsquo;s cue to exhibit more than
ordinary interest in the matter, and she merely
remarked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it might be something about
the houses being haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She noted that the paper was the <cite>Evening
Moon</cite>, and she determined to purchase a copy
before she went to bed. She did not until
the afternoon get an opportunity to leave the
house, and even then, there was so much to
do, she had to leave it secretly, and without
Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s knowledge. There was another
reason for her desire to go out. She expected
a letter at the Charing Cross Post Office, and
it was necessary she should be there before
five o&rsquo;clock to receive it. Mrs. Preedy
generally took a half-hour&rsquo;s nap in the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and Becky&rsquo;s plan was to slip out the
moment her mistress fell asleep, and leave the
house to take care of itself. She felt the want
of an ally at this juncture; the impression
that she was fated to unravel the mystery of
the murder, and thus clear the man she loved
from suspicion, was becoming stronger; and
to accomplish this it was necessary that she
should keep her present situation. She needed
help, and she could not take any person into
her confidence.</p>

<p>During the day Becky noticed that a great
many persons passed through the Square, and
stopped before the house. &ldquo;Now that the
houses are haunted,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;we shall
be regularly besieged. But if they look for a
year they&rsquo;ll not see a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Mrs. Preedy
arranged herself comfortably in an arm chair
in her kitchen, and in a few moments was
asleep. Now was Becky&rsquo;s opportunity. She
quietly slipped out of the house by way of the
basement, tying her hat strings as she mounted
the steps, and walked quickly in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Charing Cross. She was so intent upon
her mission that she scarcely noticed the
unusual number of persons in the Square.
At Charing Cross Post Office she received the
letter she expected. She did not stop to read
it; she simply opened it as she retraced her
steps, and, glancing hurriedly through it, put
it into her pocket. She heard the boys calling
out &ldquo;<cite>Hevenin&rsquo; Moon</cite>! More about the murder
in Great Porter Square! Wonderful discovery!
Romance in real life! A &rsquo;Underd Thousand
Pounds!&rdquo; and she stopped and purchased
two copies. Although she was animated by
the liveliest curiosity, she did not pause even
to open the paper, she was so anxious to get
back to the house before Mrs. Preedy awoke.
Shortly before turning into the Square, she
was overtaken, fast as she herself was walking,
by their young man lodger, Richard Manx.
He touched her arm, and smiling pleasantly
at her, walked by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pretty one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your little feet
walk fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in a hurry,&rdquo; she replied, her nostrils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dilating at his touch; but instantly remembering
the part she was playing, she returned his
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been&mdash;a&mdash;out while the amiable
Mrs. Preedy sleeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This observation warned her that Richard
Manx knew more about the household movements
than she expected. &ldquo;I have no fool to
deal with,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He shall have as
much of my confidence as I choose to give
him; he will find me his match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said aloud, with a bright look;
&ldquo;but don&rsquo;t tell Mrs. Preedy; she might be
angry with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak,&rdquo; he said in a tone of lofty
satisfaction, &ldquo;to a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to buy a ribbon,&rdquo; said Becky,
artlessly, &ldquo;and it isn&rsquo;t easy to choose the
exact colour one would like at night, so I
thought I would steal out, just as I am, while
Mrs. Preedy took her nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steal out&mdash;ah, yes, I understand&mdash;just as
you are, charming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, although I couldn&rsquo;t match my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ribbon&mdash;it was a very light pink I wanted&mdash;I
must get back quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the while they were talking he was
sucking and chewing a sweetmeat; having
disposed of it, he popped another into his
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quickly,&rdquo; he repeated, bending down, so
that his face was on a level with hers.
&ldquo;That is&mdash;a&mdash;soon. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question was accompanied by the
offer of a little packet of acid drops, half of
which he had already devoured. She took a
couple with the remark that she liked chocolate
creams best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have some,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to-morrow.
I shall walk with you; I myself
am on my way to my small apartment. It is
the&mdash;a&mdash;fashion for a gentleman to offer a
lady one of his arms. Honour me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his arm, which she declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a lady,&rdquo; she said demurely; &ldquo;I
am only a poor servant girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; he responded insinuatingly, &ldquo;am
a poor gentleman. Ah! If I were&mdash;a&mdash;rich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
I should say to you, accept this ring.&rdquo; He
made a motion as if offering her a ring.
&ldquo;Accept this&mdash;a&mdash;bracelet,&rdquo; with corresponding
action. &ldquo;Or this dress. But I have not&mdash;a&mdash;money.&rdquo;
He took another acid drop.
&ldquo;It is a misfortune. But what can a poor
devil do? You do not&mdash;a&mdash;despise me because
I am thus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I hope you will be rich one
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will happen,&rdquo; he said, in a quick, eager
tone. &ldquo;From my country&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his
hands vaguely&mdash;&ldquo;shall come what I wait for
here. Then shall I say to you, &lsquo;Becky&rsquo;&mdash;pardon;
I have heard the amiable Mrs.
Preedy thus call you&mdash;&lsquo;Becky,&rsquo; shall I say,
&lsquo;be no longer a servant. Be a lady.&rsquo; How
then, will you speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must not listen to you,&rdquo; replied Becky,
coquettishly; &ldquo;you foreign gentlemen have
such smooth tongues that they are enough to
turn a poor girl&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; They were now in
Great Porter Square. &ldquo;What a number of
people there are in the square,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;a&mdash;remarkable, this murder. The
man is&mdash;a&mdash;found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; cried Becky, excitedly.
&ldquo;The murderer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no. That is not yet. It is the dead
man who is&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;discovered.
That is it. He <em>was</em> not known&mdash;he
<em>is</em> known. His name has come to the
light. Yesterday he was a beggar&mdash;to-day
he is rich. What, then? He is dead. His
millions&mdash;in my country&rsquo;s money, sweet
Becky, veritably millions&mdash;shall not bring
life into his bones. His money is&mdash;a&mdash;here.
<em>He</em> is&rdquo;&mdash;Richard Manx looked up at the sky&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,
he is there! or&rdquo;&mdash;he cast his eyes to
the pavement&mdash;&ldquo;there! We shall not know
till there comes a time. It is sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a rich gentleman, you say. What
could have induced a rich man to live in such
a neighbourhood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In such a neighbourhood!&rdquo; Richard
Manx smiled, and shrugged his shoulders.
&ldquo;Ah! he came here not to die, surely&mdash;no,
to live. It would have been well&mdash;for him&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he came not; but so it was. What
should induce him here? you ask of me.
Becky, I shall ask of the air.&rdquo; He put himself
into the attitude of listening. &ldquo;Ha! ha!
I hear perhaps the reason. There was a lady.
Enough. We shall not betray more. I propose
to you a thought. I live in the amiable
house of Mrs. Preedy. It is high, my apartment.
Wherefore? I am a poor gentleman&mdash;as
yet. I am one morning discovered&mdash;dead.
Startle not yourself. It will not be&mdash;no,
it will not be; but I propose to you my
thought. You would not be glad&mdash;you
would not laugh, if so it should be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a shocking thing,&rdquo; said
Becky, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well. I thank you&mdash;your face is
sad, your eyes are not so bright. Then when
I am thus, as I have said&mdash;dead!&mdash;from my
country comes what I wait for here&mdash;money,
also in millions. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says the amiable Mrs.
Preedy, &lsquo;what could induce&rsquo;&mdash;your word is
good&mdash;&lsquo;what could induce one who was rich
to live in such a neighbourhood?&rsquo; Observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
me, Becky. I place my hand, on my heart
and say, &lsquo;There is a lady.&rsquo; Ah, yes, though
you call yourself not so, I say, &lsquo;There is
a lady.&rsquo; I say no more. We are at home.
You are beautiful, and I&mdash;till for ever&mdash;am
your devoted. If it were not for so many
people&mdash;I am discreet, Becky&mdash;I should kiss
your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, indeed, the remark that he was discreet
was proved by the change in his
manner, now that he and Becky were in
closer contact with strangers; the tenderness
left his face, and observers at a distance
would never have guessed that he was
making something very much like a declaration
of love to the girl. He opened the street
door with his latch-key, and went up to his
garret, sucking his acid drops. Becky
opened the little gate and went down to her
kitchen, where her mind was set at ease by
seeing Mrs. Preedy still asleep in her arm
chair.</p>

<p>Becky looked at her hand. It was a
pretty hand and small, but the work she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
done lately rather detracted from its prettiness.
There was dirt on it, too, from the
scrubbing and cleaning of the day. &ldquo;He
would kiss my hand,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I
am afraid our innocent young man lodger is
a bit of a flirt. Be careful, young man. You
are not in this house without a motive; you
are in danger if that motive touches the
welfare of the man I love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This soliloquy, in which she indulged in the
kitchen, might have been of greater length
had not Mrs. Preedy stirred in her sleep. The
slight movement was sufficient to wake her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do believe, Becky,&rdquo; she said, opening
her eyes, &ldquo;that I have overslept myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">IN WHICH BECKY GIVES WAY TO HER FEELINGS,
AND RENEWS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Great Porter Square</span> had really been
in a state of excitement the whole of the
day, almost equalling that which raged on the
day of the discovery of the murder. The
strange revelation made in the columns of
the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>&mdash;whose account of the
identification of the body of the murdered
man was presented in a form so attractive that
edition after edition was sold with amazing
rapidity&mdash;invested the murder with features
romantic enough to engross general attention.
There was love in it, there was a beautiful
and fascinating woman in it, there was a baby
in it, there were a hundred thousand pounds
in it. The newsboys drove a rare trade; it
brought so much grist to their mill that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
they jingled the copper and silver in their
pockets, they sighed for another murder as
good to-morrow.</p>

<p>The public-houses, also, throve wonderfully;
their bars were crowded, and the publicans
rubbed their hands in glee. People from all
parts of London came to Great Porter Square
to look at the deserted house. They stared
at the bricks, they stared at the street door,
they stared at the window. With a feeling of
enjoyable awe, they peeped over and through
the iron railings which surrounded the basement.
The downlook was not inviting. The
ironwork was covered with rust; the paint
was peeling off the doors and shutters; watchful
spiders, ever ready for fresh murder,
lurked in the corners of their webs. There
was nothing to be frightened at in these
natural signs of neglect and decay; but when
a man cried out, &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; and pointed
downwards, the people rushed from the pavement
into the road. They soon returned, and
craned their heads and necks to gaze upon
the melancholy walls. Occasionally a man or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a woman ascended the three stone steps which
led to the street door, and touched the woodwork
with open hand, as if the contact brought
them closer to the tragedy which had been
enacted within.</p>

<p>As night approached, the number of persons
who made a point of passing through the
Square decreased; but up till ten o&rsquo;clock
there were always about a dozen sightmongers
lingering in the roadway before No.&nbsp;119, and,
among these dozen, generally one who appeared
to be acquainted with the construction and
disposition of the rooms, and who described
the particulars of the murder with gloating
satisfaction. The police did not interfere with
them, the entertainment being one which a
free people was privileged to enjoy.</p>

<p>During the whole of the evening Becky had
not found time to read her letter or the newspaper.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll burn a hole in my pocket, I
am sure,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;if I keep them there
much longer.&rdquo; But when the clock struck
ten a period was put to her state of suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the &rsquo;ouse all day, Becky,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mrs. Preedy; &ldquo;and what with the state of my
feelings and the excitement in the Square, I&rsquo;m
quite worn out. I shall run round to Mrs.
Beale&rsquo;s for arf-an-hour; take care of the place
while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky nodded, and the moment she heard
the street-door close, she sat down at the table,
and pulled from her pocket the letter and
the copies of the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>. She read
the letter first, kissing it as she drew it from
the envelope. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Darling Girl</span>,&mdash;Your letter has surprised
and startled me, and I do not know
whether to be alarmed or pleased at the
strange news it contains. That you have
placed yourself in a perilous position for my
sake would make it all the harder for me
to bear should anything happen to you.
You would do anything, I know, rather
than cause me sorrow or add to my
anxieties, and I am satisfied that the strange
fancy you have carried into execution sprang
from a heart full of love. I have reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to know how firm you can be in any task
you undertake, and I am not hopeful that I
shall succeed in turning you from your purpose.
If, until I return to London, you still
continue in service, I implore you to be careful,
to run no risk, and never to forget that
the whole happiness of my life is in your
hands. For if the mission upon which I am
at present engaged should fail (although filial
love and duty will not allow me to relinquish
it until I see no possibility of bringing it to a
successful issue), the opportunity of our living
happily together in another part of the world
will always be open to us. But first to perform
a son&rsquo;s duty, then to offer you a husband&rsquo;s
love and care. All that a man <em>can</em> do shall
be done to hasten the day on which I shall be
privileged to call you wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have placed such trust and confidence
in me, you have so firmly relied upon my
truth and honour, that I often reproach myself
for having kept from you some of the most
important incidents in my life. But I was
pledged to secresy. I had given my solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
word never to speak of certain matters without
the sanction of my father. Thus much
you know, and you know, also, that I am now
in search of that father for whose mysterious
disappearance I am unable to account. When
I find him he will release me from a vow I
made to him under the most painful and distressing
circumstances; then I can offer you
the name which is my own, and which I renounced;
then I can unfold to you the sad
and painful story of my life; then I can hold
up my head with honour once more, and take
my place among men&mdash;the place I lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that you have something to
communicate to me which bears upon the
murder in Great Porter Square. It is, of
course, of the greatest importance to me that
I should be cleared of the suspicion which
must still attach to me; the police have sharp
eyes, and although I gave a false name&mdash;as
true however, as the charge brought against
me&mdash;it is quite possible that some person who
was in the Police Court might recognise me,
and cause me fresh trouble. Therefore I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
scarcely ever feel myself safe in the London
streets until the murderer is discovered and
punished. But above even this in importance
I place the strange disappearance of my
father. To find him is my first and paramount
desire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The picture you have drawn of Mrs.
Bailey, the bedridden old lodger, and her deaf
and nearly blind old sister, with the languid
linnet, and the moping bullfinch, is most
amusing. I shall not be at all surprised if,
in your next letter, you inform me that the
old lady&rsquo;s mattress is stuffed with bank notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How highly I value your true womanly
attempts to cheer and comfort me! To read
your letters is almost to hear you speak, you
write so feelingly and earnestly. My fullest
love is yours, and yours only. What a loving
grateful heart, what willing hands can do, to
make you happy when the clouds have cleared,
shall be done by me. Rely upon me; have
faith in me; and believe me to be,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your faithful lover,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Fred.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky read the letter slowly, with smiles
and tears; then kissed it repeatedly, and
placed it in the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>Before turning her attention to the newspaper
she had bought in the afternoon, she
ran upstairs to Mrs. Bailey. The old woman
was awake, staring at her birds. She asked
Becky to rub her side with the liniment, and
the girl&mdash;to whose heart Fred&rsquo;s affectionate
letter had imparted fresh happiness&mdash;did so
in a blithe and cheerful manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better than a doctor, Becky,&rdquo; said
the old woman, &ldquo;a thousand times better.
I was as young and merry as you once&mdash;I was
indeed. Pretty&mdash;too&mdash;eh, Becky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be seen,&rdquo; said Becky, rubbing
away. &ldquo;You have the remains now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I, Becky, have I&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you have&mdash;you&rsquo;re a good-looking
old lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gleam of vanity and delight lit up the
old creature&rsquo;s eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I, Becky&mdash;eh? You&rsquo;re a good girl&mdash;listen;
I shall leave you something in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
will. I&rsquo;m going to make one&mdash;by and bye,
but I don&rsquo;t want any lawyers. You shall
do it for me. I can trust you, eh,
Becky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you can,&rdquo; replied Becky, tucking
the old woman in; &ldquo;you feel more comfortable
now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your soft hands rub the pain away.
But it comes again, Becky, it comes again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will I, to rub it away again. I must
go down now, I have so much to do.&rdquo; She
patted the old woman&rsquo;s shoulder, and reached
the door, when she stopped and asked, in a
careless tone,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard any more mice to-night
scratching at the wall in the next house, Mrs.
Bailey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a sound, Becky. It&rsquo;s been as quiet
as a churchyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she left the room, Becky heard the old
woman mumbling to herself, with the vanity
of a child,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was pretty once, and I&rsquo;ve got the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
now. I&rsquo;m a good-looking old lady&mdash;a
good-looking old lady&mdash;a good-looking old
lady! Becky&rsquo;s a clever girl&mdash;I won&rsquo;t forget
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Becky descended to the kitchen, she
heard a newsboy calling out a new edition of
the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>. Becky went to the street
door and asked the boy if there was anything
fresh in the paper about the murder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot,&rdquo; replied the boy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only two
copies left, and I thought I could sell &rsquo;em in
the Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky bought the two copies, and the boy,
whose only motive for coming into the Square
was to look at No.&nbsp;119, refreshed himself by
running up and down the steps, and then,
retreating to the garden railings, almost
stared his eyes out in the endeavour to see
the ghost that haunted the deserted house.</p>

<p>Once more in the kitchen, Becky sat down,
and with a methodical air, opened last evening&rsquo;s
paper, and read the &ldquo;Romance in Real
Life&rdquo; which had caused so much excitement.
The writer of the narrative would have been
gratified had he witnessed the interest Becky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
took in his clever manipulation of his facts.
The most thrilling romance could not have
fascinated her as much as this story of to-day,
formed as it was out of what may be
designated ordinary newspaper material. Not
once did she pause, but proceeded steadily on,
column after column, every detail being
indelibly fixed upon her mind. Only when
she came to the concluding words did she raise
her head, and become once more conscious
of her surroundings.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, and looked before
her into the air, as though endeavouring to
obtain from invisible space some connecting
links between the new ideas formed by this
romance in real life. The dominant thought
in her mind as she read the narrative was
whether she would be able to obtain from
it any clue to connect Richard Manx with
the murder. Her desire lay in this direction,
without reference to its justice or injustice,
and she would have felt better
satisfied had such a clue been supplied.
But she was compelled to confess that, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
far as her knowledge of him went in their
brief personal intercourse, he was not in
the remotest way connected with the crime.
Say that this <em>was</em> so&mdash;say that he was as
little implicated in it as she herself, what,
then, was his motive in making his way
secretly into the room in which the murder
had been committed? Of the fact that
he had done so, without having been an
eye-witness of it, Becky was morally convinced.
What was his motive for this proceeding?</p>

<p>But Richard Manx did not entirely monopolise
her thoughts. With the threads of the
story, as presented in the Supplement of the
<cite>Evening Moon</cite>, she wove possibilities which
occasioned her great distress, for in these
possibilities she saw terrible trouble in the
future. If there was a grain of truth in
them, she could not see how this trouble was
to be avoided.</p>

<p>Of the name of the murdered man, Mr.
Holdfast, she was utterly ignorant. She had
never heard of him, nor of Lydia Holdfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his second wife, who, living now, and mourning
for the dead, had supplied the facts of the
case to the Special Reporter of the <cite>Evening
Moon</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I been in her place,&rdquo; thought Becky,
&ldquo;I should, for very shame&rsquo;s sake, if not out
of consideration for the dead, have been less
free with my tongue. I would have run every
risk rather than have allowed myself to be the
talking-stock of the whole country. Lydia
Holdfast must be a poor, weak creature. Can
I do nothing, nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky&rsquo;s lips quivered, and had she not been
sustained by a high purpose, she might have
sought relief in tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me set down my thoughts in plain
words,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;I shall then be able
to judge more clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She produced pen, ink, and paper, and
wrote the names:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lydia Holdfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick Holdfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gazed at the names and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My lover&rsquo;s name is Frederick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as though the paper upon which she
was writing represented a human being, and
spoke the words she wrote.</p>

<p>She underlined the name &ldquo;<em>Frederick</em>,&rdquo;
saying, as she did so, &ldquo;For reasons which I
shall one day learn, he has concealed his
surname.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next words she wrote were: &ldquo;Frederick
Holdfast was educated in Oxford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which she replied, &ldquo;<em>My</em> Frederick was
educated in Oxford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she wrote: &ldquo;Between Frederick
Holdfast and his father there was a difference
so serious that they quarrelled, and Frederick
Holdfast left his father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Frederick told me,&rdquo; said Becky aloud,
&ldquo;that he and his father were separated because
of a family difference. He could tell me no
more, he said, because of a vow he had made
to his father. He has repeated this in the
letter I received from him this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky took the letter from her dress, kissed
it, and replaced it in her bosom. &ldquo;I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
need this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to assure me of his
worth and truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She proceeded with her task and wrote:
&ldquo;Frederick Holdfast went to America. His
father also went to America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And answered it with, &ldquo;<em>My</em> Frederick
went to America, and his father followed
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon the paper then she wrote: &ldquo;Mr.
Holdfast and his son Frederick both returned
to England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my Frederick and his father did,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>And now Becky&rsquo;s fingers trembled. She
was approaching the tragedy. She traced
the words, however, &ldquo;From the day of his
return to England until yesterday nothing was
heard of Mr. Holdfast; and there is no accounting
for his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick&rsquo;s father also has disappeared,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and there is no accounting for <em>his</em>
disappearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These coincidences were so remarkable that
they increased in strength tenfold as Becky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gazed upon the words she had written. And
now she calmly said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they are true, my Frederick is Frederick
Holdfast. If they are true, Frederick Holdfast
is a villain.&rdquo; Her face flushed, her bosom rose
and fell. &ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My lover is
the soul of honour and manliness! He is
either not Frederick Holdfast, or the story
told in the newspaper is a wicked, shameful
fabrication. What kind of woman, then, is
this Lydia Holdfast, who sheds tears one
moment and laughs the next?&mdash;who one
moment wrings her hands at the murder
of her husband, and the next declares
that if she had been born a man she
might have been a dreadful rake? But
Frederick Holdfast is dead; the American
newspapers published the circumstances of
his death and the identification of his body.
Thousands of persons read that account,
and believed in its truth, as thousands of
persons read and are reading this romance
of real life, and believe in its truth.&rdquo; Contempt
and defiance were expressed in Becky&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
voice as she touched the copy of the newspaper
which had so profoundly agitated her.
&ldquo;Yet both may be false, and if they are false&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She paused for a few moments, and
then continued: &ldquo;Lydia Holdfast is Frederick
Holdfast&rsquo;s enemy. She believes him to be
dead; there is no doubt of that. But if he
is alive, and in England, he is in peril&mdash;in
deadlier peril than my Frederick was, when, as
Antony Cowlrick, he was charged with the
murder of an unknown man, and that man&mdash;as
now is proved&mdash;his own father. What did
I call Lydia Holdfast just now? a poor weak
creature! Not she! An artful, designing,
cruel woman, whose safety, perhaps, lies in
my Frederick&rsquo;s death. If, without the suspicions
which torture me, so near to the
truth do they seem, it was necessary to
discover the murderer of the poor gentleman
who met his death in the next house, how
much more imperative is it now that the
mystery should be unravelled! Assist me,
Eternal God, to bring the truth to light, and
to punish the guilty!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>She fell upon her knees, and with tears
streaming down her face, prayed for help from
above to clear the man she loved from the
shameful charges brought against him by his
father&rsquo;s wife. Her prayers comforted her, and
she rose in a calmer state of mind. &ldquo;I must
look upon this creature,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;upon
this woman in name, who has invented the
disgraceful story. To match her cunning a
woman&rsquo;s cunning is needed. Lydia Holdfast,
I declare myself your enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A noise in the street attracted Becky&rsquo;s attention,
and diverted her thoughts. She hurried
from her kitchen, and opened the street door.
Twenty or thirty persons were crowding round
one, who was lying insensible upon the pavement.
They cried, &ldquo;Give her air!&rdquo; and pressed
more closely upon the helpless form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glass of water!&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go
and fetch a little brandy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch a policeman!&rdquo;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s shamming!&rdquo; &ldquo;Starving,
more likely!&rdquo; &ldquo;Starving? she&rsquo;s got three
boxes of matches in her hands!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you
brute, she can&rsquo;t eat matches!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>These and other cries greeted Becky as she
opened the door, and looked out into the
Square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked, striving
to push her way into the crowd, which did
not willingly yield to her.</p>

<p>It was a poor child, her clothes in rags,
who had fainted on the flagstones before the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming to!&rdquo; exclaimed a woman.</p>

<p>The child opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked a man,
roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to see the ghost!&rdquo; replied the
child, in a weak, pleading little voice.</p>

<p>The people laughed; they did not see the
pathetic side of the picture.</p>

<p>But the child&rsquo;s voice, faint as it was, reached
Becky&rsquo;s heart. It was a voice familiar to her.
She pushed through the crowd vigorously, and
bent over the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blanche!&rdquo; screamed the child, bursting
into hysterical sobs. &ldquo;O, Blanche! Blanche!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Fanny, the little match girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Fanny!&rdquo; whispered Becky. &ldquo;Hush
my dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised the poor child in her arms, and
a shudder of pain and compassion escaped her
as she felt how light the little body was.
Fanny&rsquo;s face was covered with tears, and
through her tears she laughed, and clung to
Becky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know her,&rdquo; said Becky to the people,
&ldquo;I will take care of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And kissing the thin, dirty face of the
laughing, sobbing, clinging child, Becky
carried her into the house, and closed the
street-door upon the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; exclaimed the man
who had distinguished himself by his rough
words. &ldquo;If this &rsquo;ere ain&rsquo;t the rummiest Square
in London!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">&ldquo;JUSTICE&rdquo; SENDS A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF
THE &ldquo;EVENING MOON.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Closer</span> and closer did the little match girl
cling to Becky, as she was carried
through the dark passage and down the
narrow stairs to the kitchen. Then, and then
only, did Becky clearly perceive how thin and
wan her humble little friend had grown.
Fanny&rsquo;s dark eyes loomed out of their sunken
sockets like dusky moons, her cheeks had
fallen in, her lips were colourless; her clothes
consisted of but two garments, a frock and
a petticoat, in rags. Becky&rsquo;s eyes overflowed
as she contemplated the piteous picture,
and Fanny&rsquo;s eyes also became filled
with tears&mdash;not in pity for herself, but in
sympathy with Becky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Blanche, Blanche,&rdquo; she murmured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
&ldquo;I begun to be afeard I should never see you
agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky touched Fanny&rsquo;s clothes and cheek
pityingly, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it been like this long, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny replied in a grave tone, &ldquo;Since ever
you went away, Blanche. My luck turned
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has turned again, my dear,&rdquo; said Becky,
with great compassion, &ldquo;and turned the right
way. Make a wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thick slice of bread and butter!&rdquo; said
Fanny, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Fanny, are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad nothink to eat to-day excep&rsquo; a
damaged apple I picked up in Coving
Garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she finished the sentence Becky
placed before her a thick slice of bread and
butter, and was busy cutting another. Fanny
soon dispatched them, and did not say &ldquo;No&rdquo;
to a third slice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel better, Fanny?&rdquo; asked
Becky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever so much,&rdquo; replied Fanny, looking
wistfully around. The kitchen was warm,
and the little beggar girl was thinking of the
cold night outside.</p>

<p>Becky noticed the look and knew what it
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Fanny,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;you shall not
go out in the cold to-night. It is my belief
you were sent to help me; it may be a lucky
meeting for both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got three months,&rdquo; said Fanny,
&ldquo;and the magistrate sed he&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave give &rsquo;er
six if he could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to sleep to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; said Fanny, with a quiver in
her voice, &ldquo;is there such a thing as a coal-cellar
&rsquo;ere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sleep in it, if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>do</em> mind, Fanny. Yon can&rsquo;t sleep in the
coal-cellar.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Fanny sighed mournfully, and partly rose.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;ere, then, Blanche?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall if you like, Fanny, and you
shall sleep with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Blanche!&rdquo; cried Fanny, clasping her
face with her dirty little hands. The tears
forced themselves between the thin, bony
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that looks as if you were sorry,
Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cryin&rsquo; for joy, Blanche. I should
&rsquo;ave taken my &rsquo;ook to-night if it &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
been for you. When I fell down in a faint
outside your door, I thought I was goin&rsquo; to
die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not die, Fanny,&rdquo; said Becky;
&ldquo;you shall live, and grow into a fine young
woman. Listen to me, and don&rsquo;t forget a word
I say to you. You are sharp and clever, and I
want you now to be sharper and cleverer than
ever you have been in your life before.&rdquo;
Fanny nodded, and fixed her eyes upon
Becky&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I am a servant in this house;
my mistress&rsquo;s name is Mrs. Preedy; she is out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gossiping, and I expect her back every
minute. If she comes in while I am talking,
I shall bundle you into bed, and you&rsquo;ll fall
fast asleep. You understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a real servant, but nobody is
to know that but you and me. Put your
hand in mine, Fanny, and promise to be my
friend, as I promise to be yours. That&rsquo;s an
honest squeeze, Fanny, and I know what it
means. It means that I can trust you
thoroughly, and that you will do and say
everything exactly as I wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it <em>does</em> mean, Blanche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is not Blanche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And never was anything else. The reason
why I am a servant here is because I have
something very particular to do&mdash;and that
also is a secret between me and you. When
it is done, I shall be a lady, and perhaps I
will take you as my little maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Becky! Becky!&rdquo; exclaimed Fanny,
overjoyed at the prospect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you were sharp and quick,&rdquo; said
Becky. &ldquo;You are a little cousin of mine, if
Mrs. Preedy asks you, and you have no
mother or father. Give me those matches. I
throw them into the fire, one after another.
What a blaze they make! Your mother died
last week, and you, knowing I was in service
here, came to ask me to help you. You never
sold matches, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! I&rsquo;ll take my oath of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all I shall say to-night, Fanny. I
am tired, and I want to think. Go into that
room&mdash;it is my bedroom; here is a light.
You will see a nest of drawers in the room;
open the top one, and take out a clean nightdress;
it will be too long and too large for
you, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter, does it? Give
yourself a good wash, then pop into bed, and
go to sleep. To-morrow morning, before you
are up, I shall buy you some clothes. Poor
little Fanny! Poor little Fanny!&rdquo; The child
had fallen on her knees, and had bowed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
face on Becky&rsquo;s lap. Her body was shaken
with sobs. &ldquo;Now then, go, or Mrs. Preedy
may come back before you are a-bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny jumped to her feet, and kissing
Becky&rsquo;s hands, took the candle, and went into
Becky&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p>Becky&rsquo;s attention, diverted for a while by
this adventure, returned to the subject which
now almost solely occupied her mind. She
had not yet looked at the copies of the last
<cite>Evening Moon</cite> she had bought of the newsboy
in the Square an hour ago. She opened
one of the papers, and saw, in large type, the
heading, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Frederick Holdfast</span>,&rdquo; and beneath
it the following letter, addressed to the editor
of the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read the thrilling Romance
in Real Life which your Special Reporter, in
a style which does not speak highly for his
culture or good taste, has so temptingly
dished up for your numerous readers. It
not only <em>reads</em> like a romance, but, with
reference to one of the characters it introduces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to a too curious public, it <em>is</em> a romance.
The character I refer to is Frederick
Holdfast, the son of the ill-fated gentleman
who was murdered in Great Porter Square.
That he is dead there appears to be no reason
to doubt; and, therefore, all the more reason
why I, who knew him well and was his friend,
should step forward without hesitation to
protest against the charges brought against
him in your columns. I declare most earnestly
that they are false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, at once, I find myself in a difficulty.
When I say that the colours in which
Frederick Holdfast is painted are false colours,
that the character given to him is a false
character, and that the charges brought
against him are false charges, it appears as if
I myself were bringing an accusation against
Mrs. Lydia Holdfast, a lady with whom I
have not the pleasure of being acquainted. I
prefer not to do this. I prefer to bring the
accusation against your Reporter, who must
have allowed his zeal and enthusiasm to play
tricks with his judgment when he sat down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
describe, in his captivating manner, certain
statements made to him by a lady in distress.
He was writing a romance&mdash;there was a
villain in it (a necessity); necessary, therefore,
that this villain should be painted in the
blackest colours, to rival other villains in the
Penny Awfuls which obtain so strong a hold
over young people among our poorer classes.
The parallel is not a fair one. The villains in
the Penny Awfuls are imaginary creatures;
they live only in the brains of the cheap
novelist; to vilify them, to defame them, can
hurt the feelings, can do injury, to no living
being. But the villain your Reporter has
depicted in his Romance of Real Life is a man
who lived, who was honoured, and who had
at least one firm and true friend in the person
of him who is now tracing these lines. To
defame and vilify the dead is an act of the
grossest injustice, and of this injustice your
Reporter is guilty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at Oxford with Frederick Holdfast,
and shared in his pleasures and his studies.
We were cronies. We had few secrets from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
each other, and our close intimacy enabled me
not only to gain an insight into Frederick&rsquo;s
character, but to form a just estimate of it.
And I solemnly declare that my dead friend
was as guiltless of the charges brought against
him by Mrs. Holdfast and your Reporter in his
Oxford career as I believe him to be incapable
of the baseness imputed to him in his father&rsquo;s
house in London. Of the latter I can speak
only from presumption. Of the former I can
speak with certainty, but my conviction in
the one case is as strong as it is in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a monstrous falsehood to describe
Frederick Holdfast&rsquo;s &lsquo;career of dissipation&rsquo; as
being &lsquo;capped by degraded association with
degraded women.&rsquo; His estimate of woman
was high and lofty; he was almost quixotic in
the opinion he entertained of her purity, and
even when he felt himself compelled to condemn,
there was invariably apparent in his condemnation
a touch of beautiful pity it was an
experience to meet with in this shrug-shoulder
age, in which cynicism and light words upon
noble themes have become the fashion. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
he was free from faults I do not assert, but
his errors had in them nothing of that low
kind of vice which your Reporter has so glibly
attached to his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already said I have not the pleasure
of an acquaintance with Mrs. Lydia
Holdfast; neither was I acquainted with her
murdered husband, my dead friend&rsquo;s father.
But I have heard Frederick speak of his
father, and always with respect and love. I
can go further than this. I have read letters
which Mr. Holdfast in London wrote to his
son in Oxford, and I cannot recall a sentence
or a word which would imply that any difference
existed between father and son. These
facts go far to prove the accusation I bring
against your Reporter of libelling the dead.
He, in his turn, may find justification for the
picture he has drawn in the statements made
to him by Mrs. Lydia Holdfast. With this I
have nothing to do; I leave them to settle the
matter between them. My duty is to vindicate
the honour of my friend, who cannot
speak for himself. I ask you to insert this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
letter, without abbreviation, in your columns,
and I ask those papers at a distance which
have quoted from your Romance in Real Life,
to copy the letter, to prevent injustice to a
dead man&rsquo;s memory. I enclose my card, as a
guarantee of good faith; but I do not wish
my name to be published. At the same time,
should public occasion demand it, I shall be
ready to come forward and personally
substantiate the substance of this communication.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;I am, Sir, yours obediently,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Justice.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>To this letter was appended an Editorial
Note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We insert our correspondent&rsquo;s letter, as
he desires, without abbreviation. His name,
which at his request we withhold, is one
which is already becoming honourably known,
and we see no reason to doubt his honesty of
intention, and his thorough belief in what he
writes. In the performance of our duties as
Editor of this newspaper, we are always ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to present our readers with both sides of a
question which has excited public interest.
With these differing views fairly and impartially
placed before them, they can form their
own judgment. Upon the matter between
&lsquo;Justice,&rsquo; Mrs. Holdfast, and our Special Reporter,
we offer no opinion, but we cannot
refrain from drawing attention to one feature
in the case which has apparently escaped the
notice of &lsquo;Justice.&rsquo; By Mr. Holdfast&rsquo;s will
his only son, Frederick, is disinherited, and
the whole of the murdered man&rsquo;s property is
left to his unhappy widow. This is a sufficient
answer to &lsquo;Justice&rsquo;s&rsquo; disbelief in the
existence of any difference between Frederick
Holdfast and his father. &lsquo;Respect and love&rsquo;
would never impel a father to leave his son a
beggar.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor, &lsquo;Evening Moon.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Becky&rsquo;s eyes were bright with pleasure as
she read the letter. &ldquo;Bravo, Justice,&rdquo; she
thought; &ldquo;you are worthy to be the friend of
my Frederick. I will thank you one day for
your noble defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Fanny, arrayed in Becky&rsquo;s nightdress,
made her appearance from the little
bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, Becky,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, my dear,&rdquo; said Becky, kissing
the child.</p>

<p>Fanny&rsquo;s face was clean, and her hair was
nicely brushed; she did not look now like a
child of the gutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel all new, Becky&mdash;and so &rsquo;appy!&rdquo; she
said, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, dear,&rdquo; said Becky; &ldquo;now
tumble into bed. I hear Mrs. Preedy opening
the street door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny flew back to the bedroom, and
scrambling into bed, fell asleep with a prayer
in her mind that God would bless Becky for
ever, and ever, and ever, and send her everything
in the world she wanted.</p>

<p>Becky was prepared for her interview with
Mrs. Preedy; her plan was already formed.
She put the newspapers out of sight, and
when Mrs. Preedy entered the kitchen she
found Becky busy with her needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Still up, Becky!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Preedy.
&ldquo;You ought to &rsquo;ave been a-bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to go,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;till you
came home; I wanted to speak to you about
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Preedy, for ever
ready to take alarm. &ldquo;Nothink&rsquo;s &rsquo;appened
in the &rsquo;ouse, I &rsquo;ope. Mrs. Bailey!&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened; it&rsquo;s about myself
I want to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to give notice,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Preedy, glaring at Becky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no; I&rsquo;m satisfied with the place, and
I&rsquo;m sure no servant ever had a kinder missis.&rdquo;
Mrs. Preedy was mollified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about my
legacy and a little cousin of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Mrs. Preedy, feeling no interest
in the little cousin, but a great deal in the
legacy. &ldquo;You may sit down, Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, mum. I am to receive fifty
pounds of my legacy to-morrow, and I want
you to take care of some of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it with pleasure, Becky.&rdquo; Mrs.
Preedy was slightly bewildered by the circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of having a servant with so much money
at command; it was an unprecedented experience.
Of course she would take care of the
girl&rsquo;s money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you were out,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;there
was a knock at the door, and when I opened
it I saw a little cousin of mine who has lost
her mother, and has no one in the world but
me to look after her. She knew I was in
service here and she came to ask me to help
her. I hope you will not consider it a liberty,
but I took her in, poor little thing, and perhaps
you&rsquo;ll let her sleep with me to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Preedy stared at Becky. &ldquo;Is she
there?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to the servant&rsquo;s
bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Preedy took a candle, and went into
the room. Fanny was asleep, and when Mrs.
Preedy laid her hand on her, she moved, and
murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Becky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky called out, &ldquo;Yes, Fanny. Go to
sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Becky, upon Mrs. Preedy&rsquo;s
return, &ldquo;as my little cousin has no home now,
and as there is plenty of room in the house,
that you might let her remain here as a
lodger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a lodger!&rdquo; said Mrs. Preedy, in a tone
of surprise and satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Becky, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
ask you to let her stay here for nothing, and
as I have plenty of money I can afford to pay
for her. Then she can help me a bit now
and then. She can live in the kitchen,
and sleep with me. I&rsquo;ll look after her, and
nobody need know anything about it but ourselves.
I wouldn&rsquo;t mind eight or ten shillings
a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Preedy, with more eagerness than she
was in the habit of exhibiting, agreed to
Becky&rsquo;s proposition, and said they would split
the difference, and make it nine shillings a
week for Fanny&rsquo;s board and lodging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you won&rsquo;t mind my mentioning
it,&rdquo; said Becky, &ldquo;if you are pressed for a
few pounds I should be glad to let you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
have it till the lodgers come back to the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This offer completed the conquest. Mrs.
Preedy shook Becky by the hand, and vowed
that, from the moment she had entered her
service, she had looked upon her more as a
daughter than as a domestic, and that she
was sure she and Becky and Fanny would get
along famously together. So gushing did she
become that she offered Becky a glass of gin
and water, which Becky declined. A double
knock at the street door startled them both,
and they went in company to answer it. A
telegraph boy stood on the step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Becky live here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the two women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A telegram,&rdquo; he said, holding out the buff-coloured
envelope.</p>

<p>Becky took it, and opened it in the kitchen.
It was from &ldquo;Fred&rdquo; to &ldquo;Becky,&rdquo; and ran:&mdash;&ldquo;I
return to London by to-night&rsquo;s mail. Do
not write again until you see or hear from
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it from?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Preedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
unable to restrain her curiosity. &ldquo;What
does it say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my lawyer,&rdquo; replied Becky, without
a blush, &ldquo;and says I am to receive a
hundred pounds to-morrow instead of fifty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck&rsquo;s way, Becky,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Preedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am,&rdquo; said Becky. &ldquo;Can I do anything
more for you to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Preedy, very politely. &ldquo;Good night, Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, mum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never in that house had such cordial relations
as these existed between mistress and
&ldquo;slavey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky slept but little. The strange revelations
made in the columns of the <cite>Evening
Moon</cite>, the vindication of Frederick Holdfast&rsquo;s
character by an unknown friend, the appearance
of Fanny, the expected return of her
lover, were events too stirring to admit of
calm slumber. Her dreams were as disturbed
as her rest. She dreamt of her Frederick
lying dead on the banks of a distant river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the man who had killed him was bending
over the body, rifling the pockets. The man
raised his head; it was Richard Manx, sucking
his acid drops. &ldquo;Ah, charming Becky,&rdquo;
said the man; &ldquo;accept this ring&mdash;this bracelet&mdash;this
dress. Your lover is dead. I take his
place. I am, for ever, your devoted.&rdquo; She
fled from him, and he followed her through
her dreams, presenting himself in a hundred
fantastic ways. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will
show you something pretty.&rdquo; He seized her
hand, and dragged her to a Court-house, in
the witness-box of which stood Lydia Holdfast,
giving deadly evidence against Frederick,
who was also there, being tried for the murder
of his father. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried Becky.
&ldquo;I can save him from that woman!&rdquo; But
Richard Manx held her fast. &ldquo;I am your
lover, not he,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;you shall not
save him. He must die.&rdquo; She could not
move, nor could she raise her voice so that
the people round about could hear her. The
scene changed. She and Frederick were
together, in prison. &ldquo;There is but one hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for me,&rdquo; said Frederick; &ldquo;even yet I may be
saved. Track that woman,&rdquo; (and here Lydia
Holdfast appeared, smiling in triumph), &ldquo;follow
her, do not allow her out of your sight.
But be careful; she is as cunning as a fox,
and will slip through your fingers when you
least expect it.&rdquo; Then she and Lydia Holdfast
alone played parts in the running commentary
of her dreams. &ldquo;What do you
want to find out,&rdquo; said Lydia Holdfast;
&ldquo;about me? I am a simple creature&mdash;but
you are much more simple. It is a battle
between us, for the life of a man, for the
honour of a man. I accept. If you were
a thousand times cleverer than you are, you
shall not save him.&rdquo; Becky found herself
with this woman in the most extraordinary
connections&mdash;on the stage of a theatre, where
both were enacting characters in the drama
of the murder&mdash;by a dark river, lighted
up by lightning flashes&mdash;struggling in the
midst of a closely-packed crowd&mdash;following
each other over the roofs of houses&mdash;and
Lydia Holdfast, in every fresh presentment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
crying, &ldquo;Well! Have you saved him
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Becky awoke from these dreams in tears,
and was glad she had Fanny in bed with her.
She rose early, and at eight o&rsquo;clock went out
to buy some clothes for the child. When
Fanny appeared before Mrs. Preedy in the
kitchen, she was a decent-looking, tidy little
girl, with a world of happiness in her face.
She had found her friend, her angel friend,
who would never again desert her. She
understood in some dim way that Becky
would call upon her for help in the secret
which had caused her to assume the disguise
of a servant. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ope it&rsquo;s somethink &rsquo;ard she
wants me to do,&rdquo; thought Fanny. She would
like to show Becky what love and gratitude
could accomplish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice looking little thing,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Preedy, pinching Fanny&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>At about eleven o&rsquo;clock, Becky asked and
received permission to &ldquo;go to the lawyer&rsquo;s&rdquo;
to receive her money. Before she left the
house she said to Fanny,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t forget what I said to you last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t if I tried,&rdquo; replied Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Preedy is to know nothing. You
understand, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be out for nearly an hour. If you
hear a knock at the street door run up and
open it, and if a gentleman comes and asks
for me, tell him I shall be back before
twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him, Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No person called, however; and Becky,
returning, gave Mrs. Preedy forty pounds to
take care of. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;will
enable me to keep in this house as long as I
choose to remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the day she waited for news of her
lover. As the hours dragged on, her state of
suspense became most painful. In the early
part of the evening she received a note by the
hands of a messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;I am in the deepest
grief. A dreadful calamity has overtaken me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and I must consider well and reflect before I
move a step. I think it best for me not to
present myself in Great Porter Square. You
want to see me, I know, as I want to see you,
but before we meet it is necessary that you
should read a Statement I am preparing for
you, and which will be in your hands late tonight.
There must be no more secrets
between us. Believe me ever your devoted
and unhappy lover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock Becky received the
&ldquo;Statement.&rdquo; It was a thick packet, on the
outside of which was written: &ldquo;For no other
eyes but yours.&rdquo; When the messenger arrived&mdash;he
was a middle-aged man, with a
shrewd face and eye&mdash;Mrs. Preedy was out of
the house, gossiping as usual with Mrs. Beale,
and confiding to her the wonderful news that
she had a servant who was very rich. Mrs.
Beale gave Mrs. Preedy a bit of shrewd
advice. &ldquo;Orfer to go into partnership with
&rsquo;er, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Beale, &ldquo;and take a
&rsquo;ouse on the other side of the Square.&rdquo; Mrs.
Preedy confessed it was not half a bad idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to give this packet,&rdquo; said the messenger,
&ldquo;into the hands of a young woman
named Becky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Becky,&rdquo; said the anxious girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman was very particular,&rdquo; continued
the messenger, &ldquo;and I am to ask you
if you expected it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expected it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I was to ask you for the first letter
of the gentleman&rsquo;s Christian name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is correct.&rdquo; And the man handed
Becky the packet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the gentleman staying?&rdquo; asked
Becky, offering the man a shilling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I am well paid for what
I am doing, and I was told not to accept anything.
&lsquo;Where is the gentleman staying?&rsquo;
I have no instructions to answer the question.
There is nothing else, I think. Yes, there <em>is</em>
something else. Are you well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to say that? &lsquo;Quite well.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, say &lsquo;Quite well, but very anxious.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! &lsquo;Quite well, but very anxious.&rsquo;
Good night, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Becky went to her little bedroom, and
lighting a candle, opened the packet. Fanny
was asleep, and Becky read until late in the
night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> extraordinary story which has appeared
in the columns of the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>,
and the dreadful intelligence it conveys to me
of the murder of my dear father, render it
imperatively necessary that I should place
upon permanent record certain particulars
and incidents relating to my career which will
incontestibly prove that the Romance in Real
Life which is now being inserted in every
newspaper in the kingdom is an infamous
fabrication. I am impelled to this course by
two strong reasons. First,&mdash;Because I wish
to clear myself in the eyes of the woman I
love, from whom I have concealed my real
name and position. Second,&mdash;Because life
is so uncertain that I might not be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to do to-morrow what it is in my power
to do to-day. I pledge myself, in the
name of my dear mother, whose memory
I revere, that I will set down here nothing
but the truth&mdash;that I will not strive to
win pity or grace by the faintest glossing
of any particulars in which I may not
appear to advantage&mdash;that I will not swerve
by a hair&rsquo;s breadth from my honest intention
to speak of the matters treated herein
in a plain, unvarnished style. The dear
one who will be the first to peruse these
lines is as precious to me as ever woman was
to man, but I will not retain her love by
subterfuge or pretence, although it would
break my heart to lose it. To her I am
known as Frederick Maitland. To a number
of persons I am&mdash;in connection with the
murder of my father&mdash;known as Antony
Cowlrick. My true name is Frederick
Holdfast.</p>

<p>Between myself and my father existed&mdash;until
shortly after he married a second wife&mdash;feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of respect and affection. During my
boyhood his love for me was exhibited in
every tender form which occurs to the mind
of an affectionate father, and I entertained for
him a love as sincere as his own. The death of
my mother affected him powerfully. Their
married life had been a happy one, and they
lived in harmony. My mother was a woman
with no ambition but that of making those
around her happy. She compassed her
ambition, the entire depth and scope of which
was bounded by the word Home. After her
death my father, never a man of much
animation and conversation, became even
quieter and more reserved in manner, but I
am convinced his love for me was not lessened.
He was a man of strong determination, and he
had schooled himself to keep his passions and
emotions in complete control. He was intense
in his likes and dislikes&mdash;unobtrusively
chivalrous and charitable&mdash;disposed to go
to extremes in matters of feeling&mdash;thorough
in friendship as in enmity&mdash;just in his
dealings&mdash;and seldom, if ever, forgiving
where his confidence was betrayed, or where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he believed himself to be deceived. Such
a man is apt to form wrong judgments&mdash;as
my father did; to receive false impressions&mdash;as
my father did; to be much
deceived by cunning&mdash;as my father was.
But if he was hasty to condemn, he was
eager to make atonement when he discovered
himself to be in the wrong. Then it
was that the chivalry of his nature asserted
itself.</p>

<p>He was a successful merchant, and was
proud of his successes, and proud also that his
money was made by fair and honourable
means. He said to me once, &ldquo;I would
rather see you compelled to gain a living
by sweeping a road than that it should
come to my knowledge that you have been
guilty of a dishonourable action.&rdquo; I was
his only child, and he had his views with
respect to my future. He wished me to
enter public life, and he gave me an education
to fit me for it. While I was at
Oxford he made me a handsome allowance,
and once, when I found myself in debt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
there, he did not demur to settling them
for me. Only once did this occur, and
when my debts were discharged, he said, &ldquo;I
have increased your allowance, Frederick;
it could not have been liberal enough, as
you contracted debts you were unable
to pay.&rdquo; He named the amount of my
increased allowance, and asked me if it was
sufficient. I replied that it was, and then
he told me that he considered it a dishonourable
act for a man to consciously
contract an obligation he did not see his way
to meet out of his own resources. &ldquo;The
scrape you got into with your creditors was
an error,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you did not sufficiently
consider. You are wiser now, and what was
an error in the past would be dishonourable
in the future.&rdquo; I never had occasion to ask
him to pay my debts again. I lived not only
within my allowance, but I saved out of it&mdash;a
fortunate circumstance, as I afterwards
found. The result was obtained without
my being penurious, or depriving myself
of any of the pleasures of living indulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in by my friends and companions. I was
not a purist; I was fond of pleasure, and
I have no doubt I did many foolish things;
but no sin lies at my door. I was never
false to a friend, and I never betrayed a
woman.</p>

<p>Among my friends was a young man
named Sydney Campbell. He is not living
now, and nothing restrains me from speaking
of him candidly and honestly. He was a man
of brilliant parts, brilliant in scholarship, in
debate, in social accomplishments. He affected
to be a fop, and would assume an effeminacy
which became him well&mdash;as everything became
him which he assumed. He was as brave as
a lion, and a master of fence; lavishly prodigal
with his money, and ready, at any moment,
for any extravagance, and especially for any
extravagance which would serve to hide the
real nobility of his nature. He would hob-a-nob
with the lowest and vilest, saying,
&ldquo;Human nature is much of a muchness; why
give ourselves airs? I am convinced I should
have made an admirable pickpocket.&rdquo; But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Sydney Campbell was never guilty of a
meanness.</p>

<p>He was the admiration of our set, and we
made him the fashion. Though he affected to
disdain popularity he was proud of the
position we assigned to him, and he played us
many extravagant tricks. He led us into no
danger of which he did not court the lion&rsquo;s
share, and he held out now and then an
example of kindness to those in need of
kindness which was productive of nothing but
good. It would be to some men most difficult
to reconcile with each other the amazing
inconsistencies of his actions; now profound,
now frivolous, now scholar-like and dignified,
now boisterous and unrestrained; but I knew
more of his inner nature than most of his
acquaintances, and I learnt to love as well as
admire him. He had large ideality, and a
fund of animal spirits which he sometimes
found it impossible to control; he had large
veneration, and a sense of the ridiculous so
strong that he would laugh with tears in his
eyes and tenderness in his heart. I am particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in my description of him, because I
want you to thoroughly understand him, and
because it was he who brought me into
acquaintanceship with the woman who has
made me taste something worse than the
bitterness of death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT (CONTINUED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I do</span> not propose in this statement to refer
to any incidents in Sydney Campbell&rsquo;s
career which are not in some way connected
with my own story. At a future time I will
tell you more concerning him, and you will
then be better able to do him justice. What
I am about to narrate may tend to lower him
in your eyes, and what follows may tend to
lower me; but I am bound to speak the truth,
without fear or favour. It is well, my dear, that
to minds as pure as yours the veil is not removed
from the lives even of the men to whom is
given a full measure of respect and love.
They are scarcely ever worthy of the feelings
they have inspired. They show you only the
fairer part of themselves; the grosser is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hidden. The excuse that can be offered for
them is that they are surrounded by dangerous
temptations, and are not strong
enough to set down pleasure&rsquo;s cup untasted,
though shame and dishonour are mixed
in it.</p>

<p>A great social event was to take place. A
ball was to be given in aid of a charity
inaugurated by a Princess, and the intention
being to make this ball thoroughly exclusive
and fashionable, a committee of ladies was
appointed to attend to the distribution of
tickets. Although the tickets were set at a
high price, they were sent out in the form of
invitations, and each ticket bore the name of
the lady or gentleman who was considered
worthy of admission. Extraordinary care
was taken to prevent the introduction of any
person upon whose reputation there was the
slightest stain. Some few ladies and gentlemen
of high standing applied for privilege
tickets for friends, and obtained them upon
the guarantee that they would only be used
in favour of persons of irreproachable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
character. Among those who succeeded in
obtaining a privilege ticket from the Committee
was Sydney Campbell.</p>

<p>I, with others of our set, was present at the
ball. The Princess, assisted by a bevy of
ladies of title, received the guests, who were
presented with much ceremony. A royal
Prince honoured the assembly, which was one
of the most brilliant I have attended. In the
midst of the gaiety Sydney Campbell, accompanied
by a lady, made his appearance. They
were presented to the Princess, and passed
into the ball room. I was not near enough
to hear the announcement of the names, and
I was first made aware of Sydney&rsquo;s presence
by the remarks of persons standing around
me. The beauty of the lady who accompanied
Sydney had already excited attention, and
the men were speaking of her in terms of
admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; was asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Campbell,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;Sydney&rsquo;s
sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reply came upon me as a surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Sydney and I were confidential friends, and
were in the habit of speaking freely to each
other. Not only was I ignorant of his
intention to attend the ball, but on the
previous day he had informed me that his
family were on their way to Nice. He had
but one sister, whose portrait I had seen in
his rooms. With some misgivings, I hastened
after him to obtain a view of his companion.
She was young, beautiful, and most
exquisitely dressed, and although she had
been in the ball room but a very few minutes,
had already become a centre of attraction.
She bore not the slightest resemblance to
Sydney&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>I was oppressed by a feeling of uneasiness.
With Sydney&rsquo;s daring and erratic moods I was
well acquainted, but I felt that if in this
instance he was playing a trick, it would go
hard with him should it be discovered. My
desire was to speak to Sydney upon the
subject, and if my suspicions were correct, to
give him a word of friendly advice. But the
matter was a delicate one, and Sydney was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
quick to take offence and to resent an affront.
I determined, therefore, to wait awhile, and
observe what was going on. I had upon my
programme two or three engagements to
dance, and so much interested was I in
Sydney&rsquo;s proceedings that I did not add to
them.</p>

<p>Fully two hours elapsed before I obtained
my opportunity to converse with Sydney.
Our eyes had met in the course of a dance in
which we were both engaged, and we had
exchanged smiles. In the meantime matters
had progressed. Sydney&rsquo;s fair companion
was the rage. The men begged for an introduction,
and surrounded her; on every
side I heard them speaking of her beauty
and fascinating ways, and one said, in my
hearing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By gad! she is the most delightful creature
I ever danced with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the words, but the tone in which
they were spoken, which jarred upon my ears.
It was such as the speaker would not have
adopted to a lady. My observation led me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
another unpleasant impression. Sydney&rsquo;s
fair companion appeared to be an utter
stranger to the ladies present at the ball. Not
only did they seem not to know her, but they
seemed to avoid her. After patient waiting,
my opportunity came, and Sydney and I were
side by side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have
been waiting to speak to you all the
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My case exactly,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Anything
particular to communicate, Sydney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;O, yes&mdash;there
is something. How is it you have not asked
for an introduction to the most beautiful
woman in the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your sister?&rdquo; I asked, in a meaning
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied with a light laugh, &ldquo;to
my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did not go to Nice, then,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said she did not?&rdquo; he asked, and
instantly corrected himself. &ldquo;Ah, I am
forgetful. I remember now I told you my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
people were going there. Yes&mdash;they are in
Nice by this time, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes met mine; they sparkled with
mischief, but in their light I saw an expression
of mingled tenderness and defiance which
puzzled me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done a daring thing, Sydney,&rdquo; I
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that unlike me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but in this case you may have overlooked
certain considerations. Where is the
young lady at the present moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to the head of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;dancing with the Prince. Come,
old man, don&rsquo;t look so grave. She is as good
as the best of them, and better than most.
Do I not know them?&mdash;these smug matrons
and affected damsels, who present themselves
to you as though they had been brought up
on virtue and water, and who are as free from
taint of wickedness as Diana was when she
popped upon Endymion unaware. Chaste
Diana! What a parody! Pretty creatures,
Fred, these modern ones&mdash;but sly, sir, devilish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sly! Do I not know them, with their airs
and affectations and false assumptions of
superior virtue? That is it&mdash;assume it if
you have it not&mdash;which I always thought
dishonest, unmanly advice on Hamlet&rsquo;s part.
But now and then&mdash;very rarely, old man!&mdash;comes
a nineteenth century Diogenes, in white
tie and swallow-tail, who holds a magic mirror
to pretended modesty&rsquo;s face, and sees beneath.
What is the use of living, if one has not the
courage of his opinions? And I have mine,
and will stand by them&mdash;to the death! So I
tell you again, Fred, there is no lady in these
rooms of whom she is not the equal. If you
want to understand what life really is, old
man, you must get behind the scenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can one man set the world right?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can do a man&rsquo;s work towards it, and if
he shirk it when it presents itself, let him rot
in the gutter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I drew him from the room, for he was
excited, and was attracting attention. When
we were alone, I said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sydney, what impelled you to introduce a
lady into this assembly under a false name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s curiosity,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and a
man&rsquo;s promise. It had to be done, the promise
being given. Fred, I exact no pledge
from you. We speak as man to man, and I
know you are not likely to fall away from me.
I hate the soft current in which fashion lolls,
and simpers, and lies&mdash;it palls upon the taste,
and I do not intend to become its slave. I
choose the more dangerous haven&mdash;sweetly
dangerous, Fred&mdash;in which honesty and innocence
(allied, of course, with natural human
desires and promptings) find some sort of
resting-place. It is a rocky haven, you say,
and timid feet are bleeding there; but the bold
can tread the path with safety. If you could
see what underlies the mask of mock modesty,
as from a distance it views its higher nature,
you would see a yearning to share in the
danger and the pleasure which honest daring
ensures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not in my power to recall the exact
words spoken by Sydney Campbell at this and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
subsequent conversations; all I can do is to
endeavour to convey to you an idea of the
kind of man he was, so that you may the
better comprehend what kind of a woman she
was who held him in her toils. Sydney continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wished so much to be here to-night!
She has no parents and no family; she is
absolutely alone in the world&mdash;or would be,
but for me. Wait, old man; you shall know
more of her, and you will be satisfied. It
happened in this way. I was gasconading, I
suppose&mdash;talking in heroics&mdash;flinging my
words to the winds, and making a fool of
myself generally. Then came up the subject
of the ball. You know that the whole city
has been ringing with it for a month past, and
that a thousand women are in despair because
they could not obtain an introduction. I
dilated upon it, scornfully perhaps. A Prince
was to be here&mdash;a Princess too. &lsquo;And you
are as good,&rsquo; said I to her, &lsquo;as any Princess in
the kingdom.&rsquo; &lsquo;I hope I am,&rsquo; she answered
softly&mdash;she has a voice of music, Fred&mdash;&lsquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hope I am, but I could not gain admission
to the ball.&rsquo; I fired up. &lsquo;Do you wish to go?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Do I wish to go?&rsquo; she echoed. &lsquo;To dance
with a Prince, perhaps! Am I a woman?&rsquo; A
field of adventure was opened up to me. &lsquo;You
shall go,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Is that a promise?&rsquo; she
asked eagerly. &lsquo;It is a promise,&rsquo; I replied.
After that there was but one thing left for me
to do&mdash;to fulfil my promise, at any risk, at
any hazard. I <em>have</em> fulfilled it, and I am
content. It is like stolen fruit, old man&mdash;that
is what she said to me. A very human creature,
Fred, and a child at heart. And Grace
is dancing with a Prince, and everybody is
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child as she is,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;she must be
possessed of great courage to venture thus
into a den of lionesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake her,&rdquo; said Sydney. &ldquo;It is I
who sustain her. She told me as much a few
minutes since, and whispered that if I were
not here she would run away. A certain kind
of courage she must possess, however; liken
it to the courage of a modest and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wild flower which dares to hold up its head in
the midst of its bolder and more showy
sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw that he was in love with her, and I
hinted it to him. He replied frankly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do not love her, love itself is a delusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked him who she was, and he replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;A daughter of Eve, and therefore the
equal of a queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the substance of our conversation,
which lasted for about half an hour, and at the
end of it we entered the ballroom. During
our absence a change had taken place in the
aspect of affairs. I was not the only person
who had seen the portrait of Sydney&rsquo;s sister,
and who failed to recognise its living presentment
in the lady he had introduced. Grace
was dancing, and certain dowagers were
watching her with suspicious eyes. Sydney
observed this, and laughingly ascribed it to
jealousy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Grace were an ugly woman,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;they would not be up in arms against her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Grace is no match for these experienced tacticians;
I will soon change their frowns into
smiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no vain boast; the charm of his
manner was very great, and few persons could
resist it. Perhaps he recognised, with all his
daring, the danger of an open scandal, and
saw, further, that the lady whose champion
he was would be made to suffer in the unequal
contest. To avert such a catastrophe
he brought to bear all his tact and all his
grace of manner with the leaders of fashion.
He flattered and fooled them; he parried
their artful questions; he danced and flirted
with their daughters; and the consequence
was that at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning he
escorted his beautiful companion in triumph
from the ball.</p>

<p>The following evening Sydney came uninvited
to my rooms, and asked me to
accompany him to Grace&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She intends to be angry with you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;because you did not ask her to dance
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She was well supplied with partners,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;she could have had three for every
dance, it appeared to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was curious to ascertain the real position
of affairs, and Sydney and I rode to a pretty
little cottage in the suburbs, which Grace
occupied, with a duenna in the place of a
mother.</p>

<p>Now let me describe, as well as I can, in
what relation Grace and my friend, Sydney
Campbell, stood to each other. And before
doing so it is necessary, for the proper understanding
of what will be presently narrated,
that I should inform you that, as I knew this
woman by no other name than Grace, she
knew me by no other name than Frederick.</p>

<p>I never understood exactly how their
acquaintanceship commenced. Grace, Sydney
told me, was companion to a lady in moderate
circumstances, who treated the girl more like
an animal than a human being. Some quixotic
adventure took Sydney to the house of this
lady, and shortly afterwards Grace left her
situation, and found herself, friendless, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the world. Sydney stepped in, and out of the
chivalry of his nature proposed that he should
take a house for her in the suburbs, where,
with an elderly lady for a companion, she
could live in comfort. She accepted his offer,
and at the time of the ball they had known
each other for between three and four months.
In the eyes of the world, therefore, Grace was
living under Sydney Campbell&rsquo;s protection.
But, as surely as I am now writing plain
truths in plain words, so surely am I convinced
that the intimacy between the two was
perfectly innocent, and that Sydney treated
and regarded Grace with such love and respect
as he would have bestowed on a beloved
sister. It was not as a sister he loved her,
but there was no guilt in their association.
To believe this of most men would have been
difficult&mdash;to believe it of Sydney Campbell
was easy enough to one who knew him as I
knew him. None the less, however, would
the verdict of the world have been condemnatory
of them. I pointed this out to Sydney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sufficiently happy under the ban of those
whose opinions I despise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it affects the lady,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;more
deeply than it affects you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ignorance is bliss,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She is
not likely to hear the calumny. If any man
or woman insults her, I shall know how to
act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have thought of the future, Sydney,&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scarcely,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sufficient for the
day is the good thereof. I love her&mdash;she
loves me&mdash;that is happiness enough for the
present. One day we shall marry&mdash;that is
certain. But there are obstacles in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On whose side?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On both. My obstacle is this: I could
not marry, without a certainty of being able
to maintain her as a lady. I am dependent
upon my father, and he has his crotchets. I
shall overcome them, but it will take time. I
do not believe in love in a cottage for a man
with tastes and habits such as mine; and if
my father were to turn his back upon me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
should be in a perplexing position. However,
I have little doubt as to my being able to
guide our boat into safe waters. But there is
an obstacle on Grace&rsquo;s side. I am about to
impart a secret to you. Her life has been
most unfortunate; she has been most cruelly
served, and most cruelly betrayed. Would
you believe that when she was sixteen years
of age, she was entrapped into a marriage
with a scoundrel&mdash;entrapped by her own
father, who is now dead? This husband,
whom she hated, deserted her, and having
fled to India, in consequence of serious involvements
in this country, died there. News
of his death, placing it almost beyond a doubt,
reached her, but she did not take the trouble
to verify it, having resolved never again to
marry and to entrust her life and future into
another man&rsquo;s keeping. No wonder, poor
child! But now that I have won her love,
and that in all honour only one course is open
to us, it has resolved itself into a necessity
that an official certificate of his death should
be in our hands before we can link our lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
together. I have but one more remark to
make, and then, having confided in you as I
have confided in no other man, we need never
touch upon these topics again. It is that,
having given this girl my love, and having
won hers, no slander that human being can
utter can touch her to her hurt in my mind
or in my heart. You know me too well to
suppose that I can be made to swerve where
I have placed my faith, and love, and trust&mdash;and
these are in her keeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right. I knew him, as he said,
too well to believe, or to be made to believe,
that human agency outside himself could
shake his faith in her. Only the evidence of
his own senses (and even of that he would
make himself sure in all its collateral bearings)
could ever turn him against the woman to
whom he gave all that was noblest and
brightest in a bright and noble nature. But
soon after I became acquainted with her I
distrusted her. That which was hidden from
him was plain to me. I saw clearly she was
playing upon him, and loved him no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
than we love a tool that is useful to us.
The knowledge made my position as his friend,
almost as his brother (for I loved him with a
brother&rsquo;s love) very difficult to sustain. A
painful and delicate duty was before me, and
I resolved to perform it with as much wisdom
as I could bring to my aid. I had a cunning
and clever mind to work against in the mind
of this woman, and I played a cunning part.
It was in the cause of friendship, as sacred to
me as love. When the troubles which surround
your life and mine, my dear, are at an
end&mdash;when light is thrown upon the terrible
mystery which surrounds my father&rsquo;s death&mdash;when
I can present myself once more to the
world in the name which is rightly mine&mdash;when
my father&rsquo;s murderer is brought to
justice, and I am clear from suspicion&mdash;I shall
prove to you that I am not only your lover,
and, as I hope to be, your husband, but that
I am your friend. Friendship and love combined
are as much as we can hope for in this
world or in the next.</p>

<p>When Grace first occupied the cottage&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
call it so, although really it was a roomy
house, surrounded by a beautiful garden&mdash;which
Sydney took for her, she professed to
be contented with the occasional visits of her
benefactor and lover. In speaking of her
now I speak of her as I know her, not as I
suspected her to be during our early acquaintanceship.
She was ignorant of the character
of the man who had stepped forward to help
her in her distress, and time was required to
gauge him and to develop what plans she
desired to work out. Therefore, for the first
two months all went along smoothly. Then
came the ball, and the excitement attending
it. After a storm comes a calm, but Grace
was not the kind of woman to be contented
to pass her days without adventure. She
had, as she believed, probed her lover&rsquo;s nature
to its uttermost depth, and with winning
cards in her hands she commenced to play
her game. She said she was dull and wanted
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of company?&rdquo; said Sydney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any kind you please,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
know nobody. Your own friends will be
welcome to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was the first he introduced, and in a
short time a dozen or so of our set made her
cottage a common place of resort. Men
must have something to amuse themselves
with, and she supplied it in the shape of
cards. Night after night we assembled in
her cottage, and drank, and smoked, and
gambled. She was a charming hostess, and
some paid her court in a light way. No
harm came of it; she knew, or believed she
knew, how far she could go with such a man
as Sydney, and none of his friends received
encouragement of a nature which was likely
to disturb him. Others beside myself did not
give their hostess credit for more virtue than
she possessed, but it was no business of theirs,
and they did not interfere between Sydney
and his lady. So he was allowed to live for a
time in his fool&rsquo;s paradise. He was an inveterate
gambler, and he could not resist
cards, or dice, or any game of chance. Playing
almost always with the odds against him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
you will understand how it was that he lost,
nine times out of ten.</p>

<p>Among the frequenters of the cottage was
a young man, a mere lad, who really was
infatuated with his hostess, and was not
sufficiently experienced to cut the strings of
the net she threw around him. I will call
the young man Adolph; he lives, and I hope
has grown wiser. The tragedy of which he
was a witness should have produced upon
him an impression sufficiently strong to
banish folly from his life, even though he
lived to a hundred years. Sydney rather
encouraged the passion of this lad for Grace.
I knew that she told Sydney that he was like
a brother who had died young, and that her
statement was sufficient to make him believe
that her liking for the lad sprang from this
cause. Therefore Adolph was privileged, and
treated with the familiarity of a brother, and
became the envied of those who, if they
dared, would have entered the lists with
Sydney for the favour of their charming
hostess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>In our gambling tournaments we did not
stop at cards and dice; roulette was introduced,
and very soon became the favourite
game. One night, Adolph asked to be
allowed to introduce a friend, a cousin, who
happened to be in the neighbourhood, and
found time hang heavily on his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dozen if you like,&rdquo; said Sydney,
heartily, tapping the lad&rsquo;s cheek&mdash;&ldquo;if you
can gain permission from our Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a habit with Sydney, when he
referred to Grace in our company, to speak
of her as &ldquo;Our Queen,&rdquo; and we often
addressed her as &ldquo;Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;whether we
shall allow strangers to be introduced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at Adolph; he coloured and
stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This gentleman is not a stranger; he is
my cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you vouch for him?&rdquo; asked Grace,
playfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he afford to pay. If he loses, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
you pay his losses, if he cannot?&rdquo; asked the
most experienced gambler in our set&mdash;a man
who generally won.</p>

<p>This time Adolph looked at Grace; she
returned his look with a smile, which seemed
to say, &ldquo;Well? Do you not know your
lesson?&rdquo; But only by me was this smile
properly understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am answerable for him,&rdquo; cried Adolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough said!&rdquo; exclaimed Sydney. &ldquo;Tell
your cousin to bring plenty of money with
him. I have lost a fortune, and must get it
back from some one. Who will take the
bank at roulette? I have a system which
will win me at least a thou. to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sydney&rsquo;s system failed somehow,
and instead of winning a thousand, he lost
two.</p>

<p>The next night Adolph&rsquo;s cousin was introduced.
His name was Pelham. I cannot say
what impression he produced upon others; I
can only speak of the impression he produced
upon me. I looked at him and said mentally,
&ldquo;This man is no gentleman;&rdquo; and then again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of all the men I have ever met, this man is
the one I would be the least disposed to
trust.&rdquo; But he was cordially welcomed,
because he was Adolph&rsquo;s friend and cousin.
Our hostess paid him but slight attention, and
this increased my suspicion of him.</p>

<p>The following incidents occurred on this
night. We were assembled round the
roulette table. Mr. Pelham was the only one
among us who was not backing a colour, or a
number, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paire</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">impaire</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manque</i> or
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not play?&rdquo; I asked. I was sitting
next to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to understand the game,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you never been in Monaco?&rdquo; I
enquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I explained the points in the game to him,
but he did not appear to take any interest
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What game do you play?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cribbage,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;or ecartè, or all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fours, or euchre, or poker. I have been in
America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I proposed ecartè to him, and we sat down
to a modest game. I offered to play for high
stakes; he declined; and at the end of an
hour I had won some fifteen pounds of him.
Then we rose from our table, and watched
the roulette players; but I was more employed
in watching him than the turning of
the wheel. He threw an occasional sovereign
down, almost chancing where it fell, and he
lost with a good grace. Others were staking
their tens and fifties. Fifty was the limit;
but he never exceeded his sovereign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is enough to lose at a time,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In the course of the night I calculated that
he had lost about fifty pounds. He was one
of the first to leave, and he scarcely touched
&lsquo;our Queen&rsquo;s&rsquo; hand as he bade her good
night, and asked permission to come again.
A permission graciously given.</p>

<p>Now, the suspicion I had entertained towards
him lessened when I considered how he
had conducted himself, and but for a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
remark made by Sydney, and the incidents
that followed, I should have accused myself
of injustice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We approve of Mr. Pelham,&rdquo; said Sydney
to Adolph; &ldquo;have you any more cousins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad with a doubtful expression in his
face looked at Grace, and as it seemed to me,
taking his cue from her, replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put a little spirit in him,&rdquo; cried Sydney,
clapping Adolph on the shoulder. &ldquo;Tell him
we can fill his pockets, or empty them. Faint
heart never won fair lady yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I call this, Incident Number One.</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>We had all bidden our hostess good
night. Sydney and I stood at the street
door, lighting fresh cigars. Adolph had
lingered behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment, Sydney,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I must
go and fetch that boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I re-entered the house, softly and suddenly.
Adolph and Grace were standing at the end
of the passage, in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I do my lesson well?&rdquo; I heard Adolph
ask in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Grace, &ldquo;and I owe you
anything you ask for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A kiss, then!&rdquo; cried the lad, eagerly.</p>

<p>The reward was given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adolph!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;we are waiting for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adolph came towards me, and Grace, darting
into a room, appeared with a light in her
hand. Adolph&rsquo;s face was scarlet; his eyes
were moist and bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The foolish lad,&rdquo; said Grace to me, with
perfect self-possession; &ldquo;I gave him a kiss,
and he blushes like a girl. Do you hear,
Sydney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Sydney with a gay laugh.
&ldquo;I am not jealous of Adolph. Good night,
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I call this, Incident Number Two.</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>On our way home I asked Sydney if Grace
had obtained the certificate of the death of
her first husband. He replied that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not. There was no doubt that he was dead,
but Circumlocution and Red-tapeism stopped
the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall get it presently,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
then our course will be clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in an anxious tone. I suspected
the cause. He was thinking of his losses at
the gaming table, which by this time amounted
to over ten thousand pounds. Every man
among us held his I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck must turn, Fred,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will!&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;with all my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it does not,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I
shall have Grace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pitied him, with all my heart; but I
dared not undeceive him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT (CONTINUED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">At</span> this time Sydney began to feel the
effects of his temerity in introducing
Grace to the ball. Certain rumours and
whispers affecting Grace&rsquo;s character and
Sydney&rsquo;s connection with her, caused the lady
patronesses of the ball to institute inquiries,
and the consequence was that Sydney was
quietly but firmly banished from society.
Houses which he was in the habit of visiting
were closed against him; mothers who had
held out a welcome hand to him now frigidly
returned his bow or openly cut him; fathers&mdash;bound
to an outward show of morality&mdash;turned
their backs upon him or affected not
to see him; marriageable young ladies, with
whom, as an unengaged man, he had hitherto
been an adorable being, looked any way but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in his direction when they met in the
thoroughfares. When Sydney became aware
of this alteration in his social standing, he
tested it to its fullest extent, and having
quite convinced himself, proclaimed open
defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;War to the knife,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He carried the war into the enemy&rsquo;s
quarters. He appeared with Grace upon
every public occasion that presented itself.
In the theatre he engaged the best and most
conspicuous seats, and sat by the side of
Grace with Society&rsquo;s eyes full upon him. It
did not help his cause that Grace was invariably
the most beautifully-dressed lady in
the assembly, and that her brightness and
animation attracted general admiration.</p>

<p>Adolph espoused Grace&rsquo;s cause with complete
disregard of consequences; his cousin,
Mr. Pelham, however, held aloof, and simply
bowed to her in public.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adolph is very fond of Grace,&rdquo; I said to
Sydney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is fond of him, too,&rdquo; responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Sydney. &ldquo;What of that? He is but a
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It struck me as strange that, out of Grace&rsquo;s
house, Adolph and Mr. Pelham scarcely ever
spoke to each other; as cousins they should
have been more intimate. But this circumstance
helped to strengthen my suspicions,
and to render me more keenly watchful of
the course of events. Before long Mr. Pelham
became an adept at roulette; the first night
he spent at Grace&rsquo;s house was the only night
on which he lost. Good luck ranged itself on
his side, and he generally departed with a
comfortable sum in his possession. True, it
was represented principally by I.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;U.&rsquo;s., but
with the exception of Sydney there was not
one of us who could not afford immediately
to pay his losses. For my own part I did not
lose; I even won a little; I played for small
stakes, and Mr. Pelham, winning so largely
from others, did not grudge paying me,
without commenting on my caution or
timidity. He now always acted as banker at
roulette; taking his seat at the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
table with the accustomed air of a professional;
never making a mistake in paying or
receiving. His aptitude was wonderful.
Sydney&rsquo;s losses grew larger and larger, and
the more he lost the more recklessly he
betted. Mr. Pelham was soon his principal
creditor, and held the largest portion of his
paper.</p>

<p>One day, when I was out riding, my horse
cast a shoe. The accident happened within
a couple of hundred yards of Grace&rsquo;s cottage.
There was a blacksmith near, and it occurred
to me to leave my horse with the blacksmith,
and drop in upon Grace for a bit of lunch.</p>

<p>Upon my summons at the door being answered,
I was informed that Grace was not at
home. Having a little time to spare, I
strolled about the country lanes, and came
suddenly upon a lady and gentleman conversing
together. Their backs were towards
me, but I recognised them instantly. The
lady was Grace, and the gentleman Mr.
Pelham. They were conversing earnestly,
and I should have retired immediately had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not been for the first few words which reached
my ears. They were spoken by Mr. Pelham,
who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to gather in the harvest. We
must get your fool of a lover to stump up.
Here is a list of his I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s&mdash;in all, more than
fourteen thousand pounds. We shall be
able to cut a dash, my girl. We&rsquo;ll go to
Monaco again, and this time we&rsquo;ll break the
bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreeable,&rdquo; replied Grace; &ldquo;I am
tired of this life, and I don&rsquo;t think I could
keep up my part much longer. Sydney is all
very well, but he is too lackadaisical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think he is, for such as you,
Grace,&rdquo; said Mr. Pelham; &ldquo;too goody-goody,
eh, my girl? You want a man with a spice
of the devil in him. But he has suited our
turn, and you have played your part well.
Give me some praise. Haven&rsquo;t I been magnanimous
in trusting you with him&mdash;haven&rsquo;t
I been confiding? You wouldn&rsquo;t get
many lovers like me&mdash;trusting you out
of their sight, without ever a shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
suspicion. Then there&rsquo;s our young pigeon,
Adolph&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A child!&rdquo; cried Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite old enough,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Pelham,
&ldquo;for me to twist his neck for him if I had
any doubts of you. But I haven&rsquo;t, my girl.
It is not only love, but interest, that binds us
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed on out of my sight without
having perceived me. I was astounded, not by
the discovery, but by the coarse, brutal nature
of the plot in which Sydney&rsquo;s honour was
sacrificed. This woman, Grace, was a worthless
schemer and a deliberate cheat. The
man, Mr. Pelham, was a blackleg and a
ruffian. O, that such a nature as my friend
Sydney&rsquo;s should have been so played upon!
That such a noble heart as his should have
been so basely betrayed! Here was my
difficulty. It was the very nobility and
generosity of his nature that would
cause him openly to break with me if I
attempted to open his eyes to the treachery,
backed only by the imperfect testimony I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
could bring forward. His first step would be
to rush to Grace, and inform her of my accusation,
and once upon their guard, this man
and this woman would weave their net about
him too cunningly and cleverly to allow him
an opportunity to break through its meshes.
Whom could I enlist to aid me? I had an
intimate friend whose assistance I would have
asked, and he would freely have given it, but
he was absent from Oxford. I could think of
but one ally, a dangerous friend to enlist
because of his inexperience and of his feelings
towards Grace. But I determined to risk it.
I spoke to Adolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adolph,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;can we two speak
together in perfect confidence, as man to
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the lad, colouring, &ldquo;in
perfect confidence. I hope you are not going
to lecture me about Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I lecture you about her?&rdquo; I
asked, glad at this clearing of the ground.
&ldquo;You are fond of her, I know, but that is a
matter of the heart. You would do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
dishonourable, nor would you be a party to
dishonour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he cried, and went no
further.</p>

<p>His face was scarlet; I knew in what way
his conscience was pricked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all make mistakes,&rdquo; I said, half gaily;
I did not wish to frighten him by an over-display
of seriousness; &ldquo;the best as well as
the worst of us; the oldest as well as the
youngest of us. We have a good many
dreams in life, Adolph, to which we cling in
earnestness and true faith, and when we
awake from them and our suffering is over,
we smile at ourselves for our credulity.
You are dreaming such a dream now,
and if I rouse you from it I do so for a
good purpose, and out of consideration for
another as well as for yourself. Tell
me&mdash;why did you introduce Mr. Pelham
into Grace&rsquo;s house as your cousin? You
are silent. Shall I answer for you? It
was because Grace herself asked you to do
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Adolph, &ldquo;she asked me, and I
did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied with yourself for having
done so?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You never
saw Mr. Pelham until he made his appearance
on that unfortunate evening, and you have
discovered, as we have all discovered, that he
is not a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Grace&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; said Adolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that speak in her favour, or in his?
Think over certain events, Adolph. Mr.
Pelham, a stranger to all of us, is the friend
of this lady. But if you will remember, upon
his first visits, she and he scarcely spoke to
each other, and when they meet in public the
recognition that passes between them is so
slight as to be remarkable. There is something
suspicious in this, which even you, infatuated
as you are, will recognise. Whom
would you choose for your friend, Mr. Pelham
or Sydney Campbell? In whose company
would you rather be seen&mdash;whose hand would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
you rather shake&mdash;to whose honour would
you rather trust your honour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Sydney Campbell,&rdquo; said Adolph. &ldquo;There
is no choice between them. Sydney is a gentleman.
Mr. Pelham is a &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence; I supplied
the omission. &ldquo;Mr. Pelham is a blackleg.
You start! Before you are many days
older I will prove it to you; if I do not, I will
submit to any penalty you may inflict upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He puckered his brows. &ldquo;You are not the
only one,&rdquo; he said, biting his lips, &ldquo;who has
spoken against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are others, then, whose suspicions
have been aroused?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (mentioning the most accomplished
card-player in our set) &ldquo;says that he
palms the cards or has the devil&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proof of either in any man would be
sufficient to make him unfit company for
gentlemen, for honourable men who play fair.
Adolph, remember, you are responsible for
him.&rdquo; The lad winced. &ldquo;There is but one
manly course before you&mdash;to clear the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of this man, or to expose him. If we
are doing him an injustice in our estimate of
him, there can be no exposure; he will come
out of the fire unscathed. If we succeed in
proving our suspicions unfounded, you will
be clear. And even then I should advise you
to make a clean breast of it. Subterfuge and
deceit, my dear lad, are not gentlemen&rsquo;s
weapons. When we strike a man, we strike
him in the face&mdash;we do not stab in the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will Grace say?&rdquo; murmured Adolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>can</em> she say? In the case of an
exposure, it is you who have been wronged,
not she. She knew the character of the man
whom she induced you to introduce as your
cousin&mdash;to you he was utterly unknown. You
had never set eyes on him before that evening.
As you are answerable to us, so is she answerable
to you. And if she reproach you unreasonably,
ask her&mdash;prepare for a shock,
Adolph; I am going to give you one straight
from the shoulder&mdash;ask her whether less than
three lovers at a time will not content her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holdfast,&rdquo; cried Adolph, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
himself up, &ldquo;I request an explanation of your
words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have it, Adolph. First and
foremost, is not Sydney Campbell, your friend
and mine, is he not Grace&rsquo;s accepted lover?
You shrink; why? Because you also, in some
sense, are her accepted lover. Men have eyes,
Adolph, and you cannot be so simple as to
suppose you have escaped observation. I ask
you for no confession, but many of us have
seen and remarked upon your infatuation.
Now, say that Grace has encouraged you. Is
that honest on her part towards Sydney? Say
that you have made love to her secretly, led
on by the force of your passion, and perhaps
a little by her&mdash;is that honest on <em>your</em> part
towards Sydney? It strikes me, if the case
be as I have represented it, that Sydney is
much wronged by the young lad in whom he
places full confidence, and by the lady to
whom he has given his love. Come, Adolph,
if I have cut deep, it is out of friendship. It
is an ugly business, my lad, and I can find no
justification for it. But the worst part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
unhappy story remains to be disclosed. Sydney
Campbell is this lady&rsquo;s lover, and she encourages
him; you are this lady&rsquo;s lover, and she
encourages you; Mr. Pelham is this lady&rsquo;s
lover, and she is his. You may well turn
pale. She brings this blackleg lover of hers
into the house&mdash;into Sydney&rsquo;s house&mdash;under
false colours. On my oath, Adolph, I am
speaking the truth when I speak of Grace as
Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s lover. She plays <em>you</em> into his
hands&mdash;but you are subsidiary in the affair,
my lad. The big stake lies with our friend
Sydney. She plays <em>him</em> into this blackleg&rsquo;s
hands, and sullies the reputation and breaks
the heart of as high-minded a gentleman as
you and I can hope to meet again in life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had spoken earnestly, and I saw that I
had produced the impression I desired. Then
I related to Adolph all that I knew, and
having driven conviction home to him, we
made a solemn compact to do our best to
open Sydney&rsquo;s eyes to the infamous scheme of
which he was the victim. Adolph was to act
implicitly under my instructions; I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
how troubled he was when he left me, and I
judged it well that he should be left to himself
in his suffering. Poor lad! It was his first
experience in human treachery, and he suffered
the more that his heart was confiding
and tender.</p>

<p>On this evening it was that Sydney, in my
company, lashed himself into a furious state
of indignation at a slight that had been put
upon Grace in his hearing. It occurred in a
club, and Sidney, with a violent display of
temper, defended Grace, and attacked the
character of the gentleman who had uttered
a simple word or two to Grace&rsquo;s disparagement.
Sydney was not content with attacking
the character of the gentleman; he attacked
the lady members of the gentleman&rsquo;s family,
with whom he had once been intimate, and
called them a parcel of scheming, jealous
jades, who could not believe in purity because
they did not themselves possess it. He exceeded
the bounds of moderation, it must be
confessed, and a scene ensued that was not
soon forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The injustice of the world,&rdquo; cried Sydney
to me, &ldquo;is enough to drive an earnest man
mad&mdash;as I have no doubt it has driven
many. That gentleman and his mother and
sisters would lower their false faces to the
ground before Lady this and Lady that&rdquo;&mdash;he
mentioned the names of the ladies, but it is
unnecessary to set them down here&mdash;&ldquo;who
are wealthy and highly connected, but who
are not fit to tie the shoe-strings of my poor
persecuted Grace, nor the shoe-strings of any
girl who has a spark of virtue in her. You
have seen Grace times enough now, Fred, to
be able to appreciate her purity, her modesty,
her innocence, at their proper worth. There
lives not on earth a woman more worthy the
love and esteem of man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he broke out into a rhapsody of extravagant
adoration which would have amazed
me had I not been acquainted with the intense
chivalry of his nature. The more Grace was
vilified, the more stoutly would he stand by
her; the stronger the detraction, the stronger
his love. It was not while he was in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
humour as this that I could commence to play
the part of an honest Iago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; he cried, flourishing a
letter; &ldquo;here is my father also coming
forward to strike a feeble woman, whose only
armour is her virtue. In this letter he expresses
his sorrow at the intelligence which
has reached him that I am getting myself
talked about in connection with a woman of
disgraceful character. The honour of his
name is in my keeping, he says, and he looks
to me to do nothing to tarnish it. Nor will
I. To stand up, as I am standing up, against
the world, in defence of virtue, purity, and
innocence, can but reflect honour on the
highest, and so I have told him. Look you,
Fred; I know what I am staking in this
matter. I am staking my life, and my heart,
and all that is precious to my better nature;
and the prize is worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We adjourned to Grace&rsquo;s house, where
Sydney paid Grace the most delicate attention;
it was as though he felt that he
owed her reparation for the ill opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the world. It was an eventful night; Sydney
proposed to take the bank at roulette, and
it appeared as if his luck had really turned.
He won back all the I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s he had given
us, and his only creditor was Mr. Pelham,
who had won or lost but a small sum.
Sydney twitted him for the smallness of his
stakes, and Mr. Pelham, seemingly stung
by the sarcasm, plunged heavily. By mutual
consent the limit was increased, and the
battle between the two became so exciting
that the other players round the table
staked but trifling amounts, their attention
being engrossed by the dangerous duel.
Fortune being in the balance, now Sydney
won, now Mr. Pelham; but presently Mr.
Pelham, with the air of a man who intended
to win all or lose all, threw a hundred
pounds I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U upon a number. Sydney
looked grave for a moment, and then, with a
careless toss of the head, turned the wheel.
The number did not turn up, and Sydney won
the hundred; all felt relieved, for if the
number Mr. Pelham backed had come up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
it would have cost Sydney thirty-five hundred
pounds in one coup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pelham, tauntingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; assented Sydney, with a scornful
laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham threw down upon a number
another of Sydney&rsquo;s I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U for a hundred, and
again Sydney won. This occurred five or six
times in succession until Sydney cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Double it, if you wish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham accepted the challenge; but
now he appeared to play with greater deliberation.
He placed two hundred pounds each
on numbers 5 and 24, exactly opposite zero.
I looked at Grace; she was leaning over the
table, watching the duel with eager eyes, and
I could see that her whole soul was in the
game. Round and round went the wheel,
and we all followed the progress of the marble
with the most intense interest. The ball fell
into 28, and Sydney won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall stick to my numbers,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pelham, staking similar amounts upon the
same two numbers. This time zero appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and Sydney swept the board. Again the two
numbers were backed for the high stakes, and
now the marble rolled into number 24.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like constancy,&rdquo; cried Mr.
Pelham.</p>

<p>Sydney, with a steady hand, wrote out an
I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U for seven thousand pounds, and threw
it over to Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>Once more the same numbers were backed,
and the devil sent the marble rolling back for
the second time into number 24.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always back the last number and the last
colour,&rdquo; cried Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a novice, Pelham,&rdquo; remarked one of
our party, &ldquo;you play exceedingly well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slight sneer which accompanied the
remark was not lost upon us, but Mr. Pelham
did not appear to notice it. I believe at
that moment there was not a man in the
room who would not have been made happy
by the opportunity of picking a quarrel with
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing difficult to learn in it,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pelham; &ldquo;even such a poor player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as myself may happen to be favoured by
fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sydney, meanwhile, had written another
I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U for seven thousand pounds; he handed
it to Mr. Pelham, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will give me my revenge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pelham.
&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sydney, &ldquo;to-morrow night.
You hold a great deal of my paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham produced his pocket-book, and
added up some figures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something under twenty thousand,&rdquo; said
Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>Sydney nodded gravely, and not rising from
his seat, twirled the wheel carelessly, and
apparently in deep thought. Roulette, however,
was over for the night, and the men
broke up into small parties, some playing
hazard, some unlimited loo. I alone remained
with Sydney by the wheel. As carelessly as
himself, I threw the marble in as he turned
the wheel. He gave me an intelligent glance,
and we continued our idle game for a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of dozen turns of the wheel. Numbers 5 or
24 came up on average about once in every
six turns. Sydney rose from the table, and
in such a manner as not to attract attention
I examined the wheel. It did not occupy me
long to discover that it had been tampered
with. The spaces between the two numbers
Mr. Pelham had backed were wider than those
which divided the other numbers, and the
circumstance of numbers 5 and 24 being
opposite Zero gave the backer an immense
advantage. The chances in his favour were
increased by another discovery I made.
Where these two lucky numbers were situated
there was a deeper bevel than in any other
part of the circle. I ascertained this both by
sight and touch. There was no further
doubt in my mind as to the character of
Mr. Pelham, nor, indeed, as to the character
of Grace. The wheel could not have
been tampered with had they not been in
collusion.</p>

<p>Before we broke up, a little private conversation
took place between the two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pelham put a question to Sydney, and
Sydney replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Give yourself no anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he drew me aside, and asked me if I
could let him have a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for Grace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is short of
money; and so am I,&rdquo; he added with a
laugh.</p>

<p>I gave him the money, and we broke up for
the night.</p>

<p>Sydney and I walked home in company,
excusing ourselves from the others. It was a
fine night, and we lit our cigars, and walked
on for a while in silence, which Sydney was
the first to break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted your company badly,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;my mind is troubled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am your friend, Sydney,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>He returned the pressure of my hand.
&ldquo;Thank you, Fred. My mind is troubled
about Mr. Pelham. There is no reason why
he should not win from me as easily as, with
luck on my side, I might win from him. But
I am not satisfied. It appears to me that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
numbers he backed and won upon were the
numbers he intended to back and win upon.
If so, it denotes design. How does it strike
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you as banker, I will back numbers
5 and 24,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and will undertake to
win a fortune of you in an hour or two.
Always supposing that the wheel is the same
as it was to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It struck me as strange,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully;
&ldquo;until to-night my suspicions have not
been excited. Had any of you won my
money, I should have thought less of it. You
were trying the wheel as I turned it, after
play was over. Confirm or destroy the impression
on my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confirm it. The numbers Mr.
Pelham backed have been tampered with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lit a fresh cigar, and threw away the
old one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These things are not done without human
agency, Fred.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed not. Very skilful hands have
been at work upon that wheel. Were it not
that I desire not to risk your friendship,
Sydney, which I value highly, I should impart
something to you concerning Mr. Pelham
which has come to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not reply for a few moments, and
then he said, &ldquo;We tremble on the brink
sometimes, but it is only cowards who fly.
How beautiful the night is, Fred! The world
is very lovely&mdash;the stars to me are living
things. Even now, when I seem to feel that
Fate has something horrible in store for me,
they whisper peace into my soul. Ah, friend
of mine! that a man&rsquo;s hope, and heart, and
holiest wish should be at the mercy of a
rickster! It is sad and laughable. This
flower in my coat was given to me by Grace;
it is dead.&rdquo; He made a motion as if he would
fling it from him, but he restrained himself,
and crushing it in his hand, put it into his
breast pocket. As I looked at him with
loving pity, he put his handkerchief to his
mouth, and drew it away, stained with blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sydney!&rdquo; I cried, in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have been
spitting blood for a long time past. Now tell
me what has come to your knowledge respecting
Mr. Pelham. Do not fear&mdash;you will not
risk my friendship, upon which you place far
too high a value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said simply, &ldquo;He is not Adolph&rsquo;s
cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Adolph himself; he and I have been
speaking to each other in confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the lad&rsquo;s motive in introducing
Mr. Pelham to us with a falsehood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did so by desire of Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Grace must have been acquainted
with Mr. Pelham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It naturally follows, to the mind of one
who does not wilfully blind himself to inexorable
fact. Sydney, let us walk back in the
direction of Grace&rsquo;s house. It is a whim of
mine, and will do no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sydney,&rdquo; I said impressively, &ldquo;as surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as we are now walking side by side conversing
on a theme which is bringing torture to your
heart, so surely do I know what I dare not impart
to you. Come, humour me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned him gently towards Grace&rsquo;s house,
and we walked to the well-known spot. It
was an hour since we parted from her, but
there was no sign of repose in the house.
The windows of the sitting-room were lit up
from within, and I drew Sydney close enough
to them to hear the sound of laughter&mdash;the
laughter of a man and a woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Sydney, &ldquo;let us
get away from this place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran so swiftly from me towards the
town that it was long before I came up to
him, and then I found him with a deathly-white
face, and a heart palpitating wildly
from mental and physical exhaustion. I
assisted him home, and we parted without
exchanging another word on the subject. All
that he said was,</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night I am to have my revenge.
You will come to the cottage?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It was tacitly understood that the night was
to be devoted to a gambling duel between
Sydney and Mr. Pelham, and expectation was
on every face. Grace looked bewitching, and
exhibited more than usual tenderness towards
Sydney, and he, on his part, was never more
attentive and devoted in his conduct towards
her than he was on this evening. He was a
singularly handsome man, and the contrast
between him and his opponent was very
marked. Mr. Pelham, who was the last to
arrive, was cool and collected enough, but he
was inferior to Sydney in polish and gentlemanly
bearing. The first hour was passed in
badinage and lively conversation, and then
roulette was proposed. Sydney laughingly
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roulette will be too slow for Mr. Pelham
and myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must have a
more direct trial of skill. I propose, Mr.
Pelham, a duel with the dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dice be it,&rdquo; said Mr. Pelham, and the two
men sat down to Hazard. They played low
at first, but this was only to whet the appetite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and within an hour the stakes became
higher than had ever been played for in that
house. In the course of the play, Sydney said
to his opponent,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have promised to settle up with you in
a few days, Mr. Pelham, should you rise a
winner, and you may depend upon my keeping
my word. Mr. Pelham, gentlemen, is
called abroad, and I must not remain his
debtor. Men of honour know what is due to
each other; if I win from Mr. Pelham to-night
I shall expect him to pay me. It seems as if
good fortune were on my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It really appeared to be so, and we all rejoiced.
During a couple of hours&rsquo; play
Sydney had won from Mr. Pelham between
six and seven thousand pounds. Both men
were playing with coolness and judgment, but
even when Mr. Pelham was the setter, good
luck remained with Sydney. For a great
part of these two hours Grace remained by
the side of the players, and when she moved
away Sydney called her back, saying that she
gave him luck. By midnight Sydney had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
won back over fifteen thousand pounds, and
then an adjournment for supper was called.
All but Sydney and Mr. Pelham responded to
the invitation; they were too deeply interested
in their duel to rise from their table, and thus
it happened that they were left for a time with
no witness but Adolph, who said he could not
eat. When we returned from the supper
table they had changed their game. They
were playing now with three dice, the highest
throw for varying sums, from a hundred to a
thousand pounds. Sydney&rsquo;s good luck appeared
to have deserted him; he was now
losing heavily. He cried out to us not to
crowd round the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are playing for life and
death?&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a wild laugh.
&ldquo;Come, Mr. Pelham, two thousand on this
throw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With glittering eyes and teeth firmly set,
Mr. Pelham assented, and won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand!&rdquo; cried Sydney, and threw
fourteen. &ldquo;Ten to one in hundreds you do
not beat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Mr. Pelham, and threw sixteen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be most unfortunate in your
love affairs, Mr. Pelham,&rdquo; said Sydney. &ldquo;How
do we stand now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham passed over to his opponent a
sheet of paper with figures on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four thousand,&rdquo; cried Sydney.
&ldquo;Enough to set up a house in Belgravia. I
am weary of this work. One throw for the
last&mdash;double or quits. Your last chance, and
mine. Done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Mr. Pelham, with white lips.</p>

<p>Every man in the room suspended his game,
and rose to witness this mad play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I protest!&rdquo; said Sydney, turning almost
savagely upon his friends. &ldquo;Go to your
tables, and concern yourself with your own
counters. We can settle our affair without
witnesses. Grace, a glass of champagne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drank three glasses in succession, and
said to Mr. Pelham, with only myself and
Adolph standing by the small table,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a moment to remember. Fortune!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
be kind! I throw first. Fifteen! I am a
free man. Now, Mr. Pelham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen!&rdquo; said Mr. Pelham, raising his
box.</p>

<p>The word had no sooner passed his lips than
his wrist was seized with a grasp of iron by
Sydney, and taking up this unrehearsed cue, I
pinned the cheat to his chair. He uttered a
cry of rage, but he could neither rise nor
release his wrist from Sydney&rsquo;s hold. This
incident brought all the players to their
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Sydney, calmly, &ldquo;this
man and I have been playing for something
more than money, but it is simply a question
of honour in which money is involved that I
ask you to decide. Here are my dice, and
here my throw. There are Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s dice,
and there his throw. I call upon you to
constitute yourselves a committee of honour,
and examine the dice we each used in the
last throw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They removed the dice, and discovered
those used by Mr. Pelham to be loaded. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
would have gone hard with him if Sydney
had not interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Fair play for rogue
and gentleman! Release him, Fred.&rdquo; I released
the blackleg, and he sat helpless in his
chair, and glared at us. But he saw that his
fate was in our hands, and he submitted.
Sydney continued: &ldquo;Mr. Pelham, these dice
I have thrown with are fair dice, such as are
used by gentlemen. My throw is fifteen.
Take them, and throw against it. On my
honour, if you beat my cast, I will endeavour
to pay you what I owe you, despite the fact
that the I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s you hold of mine have been
unfairly won.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blackleg took the box, and rattled the
dice in it, gazing upon us with a ghastly smile,
and then deliberately replaced the box on the
table, mouth upwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What guarantee have I,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that
in the event of my throwing higher than
fifteen, these gentlemen friends of yours will
not set upon me, and murder me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I answer for them,&rdquo; replied Sydney; &ldquo;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
my honour that is concerned, not theirs, and
they are, in some measure, guests in my house.
You will be allowed to depart unmolested, and
to-morrow I will receive you in my rooms, and
endeavour to come to a settlement with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take your word,&rdquo; said the blackleg, and
he raised the box from the table, and rattled
the dice again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT (CONTINUED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> the interval that elapsed between
the acts of raising the box from the
table and throwing out the dice, my observation
was drawn to Grace. She stood at a
little distance from the men, bending forward,
her eyes fixed upon the box, her lips parted,
her hands clasped, and a bright colour in her
cheeks. She held her breath suspended, as it
were, as though her fate hung upon the issue
of the throw.</p>

<p>The dice rolled out of the box, and three
single black dots lay exposed. Mr. Pelham
had lost. He had thrown three aces.</p>

<p>He flung the box from him with a shocking
oath. It struck a man in the face, and he
stepped towards Mr. Pelham, with the evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
intention of striking him in return, when
Sydney interposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is for
me alone to settle this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace did not move, but her eyes were now
fixed upon Sydney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe you nothing in the shape of money,&rdquo;
said Sydney to Mr. Pelham. &ldquo;I will trouble
you for my bits of paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham, with trembling fingers, opened
his pocket-book. His agitation was very
great, but I have never been able to decide
whether it was by accident or design that he
pulled out, with Sydney&rsquo;s I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s, a number
of letters and papers, and with them a photograph.
It was a photograph of Grace. We
all saw it, and I was not the only one who
waited apprehensively for Sydney&rsquo;s next
move.</p>

<p>He took up the picture; there was writing
on the back, which he read. There was
breathless silence in the room. For a moment
Sydney&rsquo;s eyes rested upon Grace. She smiled
wistfully, as a child might smile who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
detected in a trifling fault. Sydney did not
respond to her smile. He handed the picture
back to Mr. Pelham without a word.</p>

<p>Receiving his I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U&rsquo;s he burnt them, one
by one, in the flame of a candle, calling out
the sums, which two or three of the men
pencilled down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he demanded of Mr. Pelham,
as the discomfited gambler paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sight or your memory is short,&rdquo; said
Sydney. &ldquo;I am not accounted an expert at
figures, but you will find an I&nbsp;O&nbsp;U for three
thousand, which you have overlooked. Ah!
I was right, I see. You are but a clumsy
scoundrel after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall answer to me for this,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pelham, with an attempt at bravado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will consider,&rdquo; said Sydney, &ldquo;whether it
is necessary to chastise you. But not to-night,
nor in this house. We must not forget that a
lady is present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed with exquisite politeness to Grace,
and then addressed his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I requested you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to constitute
yourselves a committee of honour, to examine
the dice this person used against me. I ask
you now to examine the roulette wheel, and to
say whether there is any indication that the
numbers 5 and 24 have been tampered with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wheel was examined, and my suspicions
were confirmed. Upon the verdict being
given, Sydney said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person to whom I lost fourteen
thousand pounds last night upon number 24
must be accomplished in many ways; for it
is only by breaking into the house when its
inmates were asleep that he could so skilfully
have dealt with the wheel for his own purpose.
I cannot congratulate you upon your cousin,
Adolph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad, with burning blushes, turned his
face away, and Sydney, advancing courteously
to Grace, offered her his hand. Wondering,
and with a look of mingled apprehension and
admiration, she placed her hand in his. He
led her to Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a bitter mistake,&rdquo; he said to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
blackleg. &ldquo;I believed myself to be the
possessor of a jewel to which I had no claim.
I resign her; although I believe at this
moment&rdquo;&mdash;and here he looked her direct in
the face&mdash;&ldquo;that she would follow me, and
prove false to you, if I invited her by a word.
I withstand the temptation; I will not rob
you of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sydney!&rdquo; cried Grace, holding out her
hands to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you?&rdquo; he asked of Mr.
Pelham; and then, turning to Grace, he said,
&ldquo;Rest content. You have broken my heart.
Either I was not worthy of you, or you were
not worthy of me. It matters not, now that
our eyes are opened. Mr. Pelham, I was
guilty of an error to-night when I said you
were unfortunate in your love affairs. Many
men would envy you. Come, gentlemen,
enough of this. The play is over; drop the
curtain! Adolph, my lad, I am sorry for you,
but it is the way of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What followed was so bewildering and
unexpected that I cannot clearly recall it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
There was a sudden movement, some passionately
tender words from Grace, some furious
ones from Mr. Pelham. I cannot say whether
there was a struggle; my only clear remembrance
is that, after a lapse of a few moments,
during which we were all in a state of inexplicable
excitement and confusion, I saw
Grace&rsquo;s arms round Sydney&rsquo;s neck, that
Sydney, struggling to release himself, uttered
a cry and slipped to the ground, with blood
rushing from his mouth. He had broken a
blood-vessel, and before a doctor arrived he
was dead. He died in the presence of the
woman who had betrayed him, and almost his
last look was one of mingled horror and
anguish as she leant over him in affright.
Thus ended the life of my chivalrous, rash, and
noble-hearted friend.</p>

<p>Such an affair as this could not be hushed
up. There were an inquiry and an inquest,
but there was no room for suspicion of foul
play. The medical evidence proved that
Sydney died from the bursting of a blood
vessel; but in my mind there was no shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of a doubt that Grace was the indirect cause
of his death. In my eyes she was a
murderess.</p>

<p>She disappeared from the place, and Mr.
Pelham with her. I visited the cottage a
fortnight after Sydney was buried. All the
furniture had been removed, and the cottage
was empty.</p>

<p>The tragic termination of this ill-fated connection
produced a great impression upon
many of our set. For myself I can say that
it made me more permanently serious in my
thoughts; from that time I have never played
for money.</p>

<p>Before the occurrence of the events I have
described my mother had died. Up to this
time, and for a little while afterwards, my
father and I had corresponded regularly, but
I did not make him acquainted with the
details of the story of Sydney&rsquo;s career. Incidentally,
at the time of Sydney&rsquo;s death, I
mentioned that I had lost a dear friend, and
that was all my father knew of the affair.</p>

<p>A break occurred in our correspondence&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
on my part; on my father&rsquo;s. For three
weeks or a month I did not hear from him,
until I wrote and asked him if he was well.
He replied in a very few words; he was quite
well, he said, but he was engaged in affairs so
momentous and engrossing that he could not
find time to write at length. I surmised that
he was speculating largely, and I wrote to him
telling him not to harass himself by writing
me long letters; all I wanted was to know
that he was in good health. For three or four
months I heard from him but rarely; then,
one day came a letter with the astonishing
intelligence that he had married again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be surprised at the news,&rdquo; wrote
my father, &ldquo;but I feel you will rejoice when
you know that this step, which I have taken
almost in secret, will contribute to my happiness.
Your second mother is a most charming
young lady, and I am sure you will have
a great affection for her. I shall presently
ask you to come to London to make her
acquaintance, when we can discuss another
matter more important to yourself. It is time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
you commenced a career. Be assured of this&mdash;that
my marriage will make no difference in
your prospects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no just cause for anger or uneasiness
in the circumstance of my father marrying
again, but I was hurt at the secrecy of the
proceeding. He spoke of his wife as &ldquo;a
charming young lady,&rdquo; and it was clear from
the tone of his letter that his heart was
engaged. My father possessed sterling
qualities, but I could not help confessing to
myself that he was scarcely the kind of man
to win the love of a charming young lady.
Who was she, and why had I not been informed
of the engagement or invited to the
wedding? My father stood in no fear of me;
he was a man who stepped onward in his own
path, and who had been all his life in the
habit of judging and deciding for himself.
Thinking of him alone I could find absolutely
no reason why he should not have confided in
me, but when my thoughts turned in the
direction of the young lady an explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
presented itself. That it was not complimentary
to her made me all the more anxious
for my father. But upon deliberation I withheld
my final judgment until I had seen my
mother-in-law. The invitation to London
arrived, and I waited first upon my father in
his city office. He received me with abundant
love; I had written him a letter, wishing him
every happiness, and it had given him great
gratification. He confessed to me that it was
not in accordance with his desire that I had
not been informed of the engagement. &ldquo;It
was a young lady&rsquo;s whim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
was bound in gallantry to yield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are happy?&rdquo; I asked, evading the
point. The situation as between father and
son was particularly awkward to him, and my
wish was to set him as much as possible at
his ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Let me
anticipate your questions, and give you some
information about her. The young lady is
poor and an orphan. Her name was Lydia
Wilson. She was without family, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
friends, and without money. I made her
acquaintance accidentally a few months ago
in the course of business, and was attracted
to her. She was in a dependent and cruel
position, and I made her an offer of marriage
which she accepted. There is no need for us
to go into further particulars. I thought
much of you, and your manner of receiving
the news of this unexpected step has delighted
me. All that remains for you to do is to
make the acquaintance of a lady who I feel
is too young to be my wife, but who has done
me infinite honour by assuming my name&mdash;who
is too young to be a second mother to
you, but whom you will find a charming and
true friend. Numbers of persons will say
that it is an imprudent step for a man of my
age to marry a mere child; I must confess it
is likely I should pass that judgment upon
another man in my position; but I was unable
to resist her, and I am happy in the assurance
that, despite the disparity in our ages, she
loves me. You will find in her, Frederick, a
singular mixture of simplicity, shrewdness,
and innocence. And now, my dear boy, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
will go home to her; she is anxiously awaiting
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father&rsquo;s wife was not visible when we
reached home, and my father told me she
was dressing, and would not come down till
dinner was on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that friends
were to dine with us to-night. I should have
liked the three of us to spend the evening
together, but there will be plenty of opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We both retired to dress for dinner, and
upon my re-entering the room the guests
were arriving&mdash;fifteen or sixteen of them.
They were all strangers to me, and as I was
introduced to them by my father an uncomfortable
impression forced itself upon
me that they were not persons who moved
in the first class. There were two foreign
noblemen among them whose titles I doubted,
and an American upon whose shirt-front was
stamped Shoddy. Scarcely a moment before
dinner was announced, my father&rsquo;s wife
entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;this is my
wife. My dear, this is my son, of whom I
have spoken so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then dinner was announced, and my father
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick, you will take in Mrs. Holdfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What with the ceremonious bow with
which my father&rsquo;s wife received me, and the
bustle occasioned by the announcement of
dinner, I had not time to look into the lady&rsquo;s
face until her hand was on my arm. When
I did look at her I uttered a smothered cry,
for the woman I was escorting to dinner was
no other than Grace, through whose abominable
treachery my friend Sydney Campbell
had met his death.</p>

<p>The shock of the discovery was so overwhelming
that I lost my self-possession. I
felt as if the scene on that dreadful night
were being enacted over again, and as we
moved onwards to the dining-room I repeated
the words uttered by Sydney to Grace, which
had rang in my ears again and again, &ldquo;Rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
content. You have broken my heart. Either
I was not worthy of you, or you were not
worthy of me. The play is over; drop the
curtain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice of my father&rsquo;s wife recalled me
to myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What strange words you are muttering!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, in a sweet voice. &ldquo;Are they
from a book you are writing? Mr. Holdfast
tells me you are very clever, Frederick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are words spoken by a dear friend,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;at a tragic period in his life&mdash;a few
moments, indeed, before he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shocking,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to think of
them now when you and I meet for the first
time! A dear friend of yours? You shall
tell me all about it, Frederick. You do not
mind my calling you Frederick, do you? I
have been thinking for days, and days, and
days, what I should call you. Not Mr. Holdfast&mdash;that
is my husband; nor Master
Frederick.&rdquo; She laughed heartily at this
notion. &ldquo;No, it shall be Frederick. And
you musn&rsquo;t call me mother; that would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
too ridiculous. Nor madam; that would be
too distant. You must call me Lydia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pretty name,&rdquo; I said, summoning
all my fortitude and composure; &ldquo;is it your
only one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Is not one
enough for such a little creature as me? I
hope,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you are not angry
with me for marrying your father. I could
not help it, indeed, indeed I could not! He
loved me so much&mdash;better even than he loves
you, I believe, and his nature is so great and
noble that I would not for the world give
him the slightest pain. He feels so deeply!
I have found that out already, and he is
ready to make any sacrifice for me. We are
both very, very happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had succeeded in making me more
clearly understand the extraordinary difficulty
of my position. Whether she did this designedly
or not was not so clear, for every
word she spoke might have been spoken by
a simple innocent woman, or by a woman
who was playing a double part. I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
discover whether she recognised me. She
exhibited no sign of it. During the dinner
she was in the highest spirits, and my father&rsquo;s
eyes followed her in admiration. Knowing
his character, and seeing how deeply he was
enamoured of this false and fascinating
woman, I trembled perhaps more than she
did at the consequences of an exposure.</p>

<p>But was it possible, after all, that I could
be mistaken? Were there two women so
marvellously alike in their features, in
manner, in the colour of their hair and
eyes, and could it have been my fate to
meet them in positions so strange and close
to me?</p>

<p>I observed her with the closest attention.
Not a word, not a tone, not a gesture, escaped
me; and she, every now and then, apparently
unconscious of what was in my mind, addressed
me and drew me into conversation
in the most artless manner. She demanded
attention from me with the usual licence of
beauty, and later on in the evening my father,
linking his arm in mine, said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind is relieved of a great anxiety. I
am glad you like Lydia; she is delighted with
you, and says she cannot look upon you with
a mother&rsquo;s eyes. She will be your sister, she
says, and the best friend you have in the
world. Our home will once more be happy,
as in your mother&rsquo;s days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I slept but little during the night, and the
following day and for days afterwards devoted
myself to the task of confirming or destroying
the horrible suspicion which haunted me. I
saw enough to convince me, but I would make
assurance doubly sure, and I laid a trap for
her. I had in my possession a photograph of
Sydney, admirably executed and handsomely
framed, and I determined to bring it before
her notice suddenly, and when she supposed
herself to be alone. Winter was drawing near,
and the weather was chilly. There were fires
in every room. We were to go to the theatre,
she, my father, and I. Dressing quickly I
went into our ordinary sitting-room, where a
large fire was burning. I turned the gas low,
placed the photograph on the table so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was likely to attract observation, and threw
myself into an arm chair in a corner of the
room which was in deep shadow. I heard the
woman&rsquo;s step upon the stairs, and presently
she entered the room, and stood by the table,
fastening a glove. While thus employed, her
eyes fell upon the photograph. I could not
see the expression on her face, but I saw her
take the picture in her hand and look at it for
a moment; then she stepped swiftly to the
fireplace, and kneeling down, gazed intently at
the photograph. For quite two minutes did
she so kneel and gaze upon the picture, without
stirring. I rose from my chair, and turned up
the gas. She started to her feet, and confronted
me; her face was white, her eyes were
wild.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are interested in that picture,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;you recognise it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour returned to her cheeks&mdash;it was as
though she willed it&mdash;her eyes became calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I recognise it?&rdquo; she asked, in
a measured tone. &ldquo;It is the face of a gentleman
I have never seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the face of my friend, my dear friend,
Sydney Campbell,&rdquo; I replied, sternly, &ldquo;who
was slain by a heartless, wicked woman. I
have not told you his story yet, but perhaps
you would scarcely care to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her quick ears had caught the sound of my
father&rsquo;s footsteps. She went to the door, and
drew him in with a caressing motion which
brought a look of tenderness into his eyes.
There was something of triumph in her voice&mdash;triumph
intended only for my understanding&mdash;as
she said to her husband,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a picture of Frederick&rsquo;s dearest
friend, who met with&mdash;O! such a dreadful
death, through the heartlessness of a wicked
woman! What did you say his name was,
Frederick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forced to reply, I said, &ldquo;Sydney Campbell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw that I had to do with a cunning and
clever woman, and that all the powers of my
mind would be needed to save my father from
shame and dishonour. But I had no idea of
the scheme my father&rsquo;s wife had devised for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
my discomfiture, and no suspicion of it crossed
my mind even when my father said to me, in
the course of the night,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lydia is charmed with you, Frederick.
She says no one in the world has ever been
more attentive to her. She loves you with a
sister&rsquo;s love. So all things have turned out
happily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this miserable way three weeks passed,
without anything further being said, either by
her or myself, upon what was uppermost in
our minds. Convinced that she was thoroughly
on her guard against me, and convinced also
of the necessity of my obtaining some kind of
evidence before I could broach the subject to
my father, I employed a private detective,
who, at the end of these three weeks had something
to report. The woman, it appears, went
out shopping, and as nearly as I can remember
I will write the detective&rsquo;s words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady did not go in her carriage. She
took a hansom, and drove from one shop to
another, first to Regent Street, then to Bayswater,
then to the Elephant and Castle. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
round-about drive, but I did not lose sight of
her. At the Elephant and Castle she went
into Tarn&rsquo;s, paying the cabman, who drove
off. I have his number and the number of
every cab the lady engaged. When she came
out of Tarn&rsquo;s, she looked about her, and went
into a confectioner&rsquo;s shop near at hand, where
there were tables for ladies to sit at. There
was nothing in that&mdash;she must have been
pretty tired by that time. Lemonade and
cakes were brought to her, and she made short
work of them. There was nothing in that&mdash;the
lady has a sweet tooth; most ladies have;
but I fancied that she looked up at the clock
once or twice, a little impatiently. She finished
her cakes, and called for more, and before
she had time to get through the second plateful,
a man entered the shop, and in a careless
way took his seat at the same table. As I
walked up and down past the window&mdash;for it
wouldn&rsquo;t have done for me to have stood still
staring through it all the time&mdash;I saw them
talking together, friendly like. There was
nothing out-of-the-way in their manner; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
were talking quietly, as friends talk. After
about a quarter-of-an-hour of this, the man
shook hands with her, and came out of the
shop. Then, a minute or two afterwards, the
lady came out of the shop. She walked about
a hundred yards, called a cab, drove to a
jeweller&rsquo;s shop in Piccadilly, discharged the
cab, came out of the jeweller&rsquo;s shop, took
another cab, and drove home. Perhaps you
can make something out of it. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing strange,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;in a
lady going into a confectioner&rsquo;s shop at such
a distance from home, and there meeting a
gentleman, with whom she remains conversing
for a quarter of an hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing strange in it to me,&rdquo; replied
the detective. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the
goings-on of women, sir, nor the artfulness of
them. Many a lady will do more than that,
just for the purpose of a harmless bit of flirtation;
and they like it all the better because of
the secresy and the spice of danger. No, sir,
I don&rsquo;t see anything in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Describe the man to me,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>He did so, and in the description he gave I
recognised the scoundrel, Mr. Pelham. Even
now this shameful woman, married to my
father, was carrying on an intrigue with her
infamous lover. There was no time to lose.
I must strike at once.</p>

<p>My first business was with the woman. If
I could prevail upon her to take the initiative,
and leave my father quietly without an open
scandal&mdash;if I could induce her to set a price
upon her absence from the country, I had no
doubt that I could secure to her a sufficient
sum to enable her to live in comfort, even in
affluence, out of England. Then I would
trust to time to heal my father&rsquo;s wounds. It
was a cruel blow for a son to inflict upon his
father, but it was not to be borne that the
matter should be allowed to continue in its
present shape. Not only shame and dishonour,
but other evils might spring from it.</p>

<p>Within a few hours I struck the first blow.
I asked her for an interview. She called me
into her boudoir. I should have preferred a
more open room, but she sent word by a maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as treacherous as herself, whom she doubtless
paid well, that if I wished to speak to her on
that day it must be where she wished. I presented
myself, and closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; she said, with her sweetest smile.
&ldquo;This is to be a very, very private conversation!
Hand me my smelling bottle, Frederick.
Not that one; the diamond and the turquoise
one your father gave me yesterday. There
are no bounds to my husband&rsquo;s generosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that such a nature
as his should be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a thousand pities!&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Who would be so unkind! Not
you, I am sure; your heart is too tender;
you are too fond of your father. As for me,
he knows my feelings for him. He is husband,
friend, and father, all in one, to me. His
exact words, I assure you. Trifle with such
a man! No, indeed; it would be too cruel!
Come and sit here, by my side, Frederick. If
you refuse, I declare I will ring for my maid,
and will not speak to you&mdash;no, not another
word! Now you are good; but you look too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
serious. I hate serious people. I love pleasure
and excitement. That is because I am
young and not bad looking. What do you
think? You can&rsquo;t say I am ugly. But perhaps
you have no eyes for me; your heart is
elsewhere&mdash;in that locket on your chain. I
must positively see the picture it contains.
No? I must, indeed!&mdash;and then I will be
quiet, and you shall talk. You have no idea
what an obstinate little creature I am when I
get an idea into my head, and if you don&rsquo;t let
me see the inside of that locket, I shall ring
for my maid. Thank you. Now you <em>are</em>
good! It is empty, I declare. It is a pretty
locket. You have good taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no picture in the locket; it was
worn on my chain from harmless vanity. I
had disengaged it from the chain, and she
held it in her hand. Suddenly she turned her
face close to mine, and said, in the same
languid tone, but with a certain meaning in it,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;shall I relate to you the
story of Sydney Campbell?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The directness of my attack frightened her.
Her hands, her lips, her whole body trembled;
tears filled her eyes, and she looked at me so
piteously that for a moment I doubted whether
I was not sitting by the side of a helpless child
instead of a heartless, cruel, wicked woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame, to take advantage of a defenceless
girl! You don&rsquo;t know the true
story&mdash;you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t! What have you
seen me do that you come here, because I
happen to have married your father, to threaten
and frighten me? What can you say against
me? That I have been unfortunate. O,
Frederick, you don&rsquo;t know how unfortunate!
You don&rsquo;t know how I have been treated, and
how I have suffered! Have you no pity?
Even if I have committed an error through
ignorance, should I not be allowed an opportunity
to reform? Am I to be utterly abandoned&mdash;utterly
lost? And are you going to
crush me, and send me wandering through the
world again, with no one to love or sympathise
with me? That portrait of mine which was
in Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s pocket-book, and which Sydney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
saw, was stolen from me, and what was written
on the back was forged writing. If a man
loves me, can I help it? It is nothing to do
with me whether he is a gentleman or a blackguard.
Pelham loved me, and he was a cheat.
Was that my fault? Have pity, have pity,
and do not expose me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had fallen on her knees, and had grasped
my hands, which I could not release from her
grasp, and as she poured out her piteous
appeal I declare I could not then tell whether
it was genuine or false. I knew that, if this
woman were acting, there is no actress on our
stage who could excel her. What a danger
was here! Acting thus before me, who was
armed against her, how would she act in the
presence of my father, who had given her his
heart? But soon after she had ceased to
speak, my calmer sense returned to me, and
I seized the point it was necessary to drive
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what I can say
against you? I can say this. Two days before
Sydney died in your house, I was witness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a secret meeting between you and your lover,
Mr. Pelham. I can repeat, word for word,
certain remarks made by you and by him
which leave no doubt as to the tie which
bound you together. You liked a man with
a spice of the devil in him&mdash;my poor friend
Sydney was too tame a lover for you. Do you
not remember those words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You listened,&rdquo; she exclaimed, scornfully,
&ldquo;and you call yourself a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not seek to save myself from your
reproaches. The knowledge was forced upon
me, and I could neither advance nor retire
without discovering myself, and so affording
a scoundrel an opportunity of escape. At
that time Sydney was indebted to Mr. Pelham
a large sum of money, whether fairly won or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not tell Sydney?&rdquo; she asked,
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. More than that. The night before
his death he and I, after leaving you, returned
to your cottage and saw the lights, and heard
Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s laugh and yours. Do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
why I tell you these things? It is to convince
you that you cannot hope to destroy the
evidence it is in my power to bring against
you. I should have been content never to
have met you again after the death of my
friend; I hoped that we had seen the last of
each other. But you have forced yourself
into this house&mdash;you have ensnared my father&mdash;and
if you remain you will bring upon him
a more terrible shock than now awaits him in
the discharge of my duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a clever enemy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;so
strong and relentless, and determined! How
can I hope to contend with you? Yet I
believe I could do so successfully, if you have
told me all you know against me. You overheard
a conversation between me and Pelham&mdash;what
of that? You have no witnesses. But
will you not give me a chance? If, when you
first met me, I was led into error by a
scoundrel, who was exposed and disgraced in
your presence, shall I be allowed no loophole
through which I can creep into a better kind
of life? It is the way men treat women, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
I might expect something better from you.
You cannot unmake me your father&rsquo;s wife. I
am that, in spite of you or a thousand sons.
Why not let things remain as they are&mdash;why
should not you and I be friends, only outwardly,
if you like, to save your father from
pain? Let it be a bargain between us&mdash;for
his sake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held out her hand to me; I did not
touch it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pain my father must bear,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but
I will endeavour to save him from a deep
disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not disgracing him now!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Indeed, indeed I am not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to what depths the nature of this
woman would descend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see Mr. Pelham last?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him for months&mdash;for
many, many months! He has left the country,
never to return. I hope he is dead&mdash;with all
my heart I hope he is dead! He is the cause
of all my misery. I told him so, and refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ever to see him again. He was in despair,
and he left me for ever. I prayed with
thankfulness&mdash;on my knees I prayed&mdash;when
he said good-bye! He is thousands of miles
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gazed at her steadily. &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;you met him by appointment this very
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT (CONTINUED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">All</span> the colour died out of her face, and
I saw that I had frightened her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she asked, in a faint
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my secret,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It should
be sufficient for you that I do know, and that
I have evidence at hand for a full exposure of
your proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own evidence will not be strong
enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hating me as you do,
you can invent any wicked story you please&mdash;it
does not require a very clever man to do
things of that kind. It has been done over
and over again, and the question then is,
whose word has the greatest influence? My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
husband will take my word against yours; I
promise you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of the power you have over
him, and I am prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way are you prepared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you how many cabs you took
this morning, and their numbers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can; and I can tell you, moreover,
where you engaged and where you discharged
them; and what shops you went to and how
long you were in each. When I relate your
wretched story to my father I shall be able to
verify every detail of the accusation I shall
bring against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had me watched!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was necessary. You are a clever
woman.&rdquo; (Even in this terrible crisis of her
fate, the vanity of this creature, unparalleled
in wickedness, asserted itself, and an expression
of gratification passed into her face as I
called her a clever woman.) &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
nature in some respects resembles Sydney&rsquo;s,
and especially in its loyalty to love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
friendship. Upon Sydney no impression
could be made against any person in whom he
had confidence, unless the most distinct proof
could be produced&mdash;the evidence of his own
senses or of witnesses upon whom he could
implicitly rely. So would it be with my
father. On my honour, you can no longer live
in this house. I cannot permit you for
another day to impose upon a gentleman
whom I love and honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gazed at me in admiration. &ldquo;How
beautifully you speak! Your words are like
knives&mdash;they cut into my heart. You have
brought my guilt home to me, O, how clearly!
Yes, I <em>am</em> guilty! I confess it! I yield; I
cannot struggle with such a skilful enemy as
you. O, if you knew what relief you have
given me! I was so weary! I am glad you
were not weak&mdash;I am glad you had no pity
upon me. I am sick of the deception I have
been compelled&mdash;yes, compelled!&mdash;to practice
against a good man. And he is not the only
one&mdash;there have been others, miserable woman
that I am. O, what an unhappy weary life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
mine has been! I have been driven and
driven by a villain who has preyed upon me
since I was a child. Ah, if you knew the
whole truth, if I could lay bare my heart, you
would not utterly condemn me! You would
say, &lsquo;Poor child! she has been more sinned
against than sinning!&rsquo; Are not those the
words used to persons who have been innocently
led into error? And they are true of
me! If I have sinned I have been driven to
it, and I have been sinned against&mdash;indeed,
indeed I have! But I don&rsquo;t want to turn you
in my favour. You must do your duty, and I
must meet my punishment, now that everything
is discovered. It might have been
different with me if it had been my happiness
to meet a man like you when I was young.
I am young still&mdash;I look it, don&rsquo;t I? and it
makes me feel all the more wicked. But I
feel a hundred years old&mdash;quite a hundred&mdash;and
O, so tired and worn out! I could have
looked up to you, I could have respected you,
and you would have taught me what was
right and what was wrong. But it was not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
be&mdash;and it is too late now, is it not? Yes, I
see in your face that it is too late. What are
you going to do with me? You will not be
too, too cruel? I am wicked, I feel&mdash;you
have made me feel it, and I am so thankful to
you! but unless I make away with myself
(and I am afraid to do that; I should be
afraid to die)&mdash;unless I did that, which I
should never have the courage to do, I shall
live a good many years yet. My fate is in your
hands. What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not attempt to interrupt her, nor to
stem her singularly-worded appeal. &ldquo;Your
fate,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is in your own hands, not in mine.
I can show you how you can avoid an open
exposure, and secure for yourself an income
sufficiently large to live in comfort all your
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; she exclaimed, clasping her
hands. &ldquo;O, how good you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The line of action,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I advise you
to adopt is the best for all parties implicated
in this miserable business, and is the most
merciful both to you and my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>She interrupted me with, &ldquo;Never, never,
shall I be able to repay you. It is almost as if
you were a lawyer looking after my interests,
and as if I were one of your favourite clients.
You cannot hate me, after all, or you would
never advise me as you are doing. What
line of action&mdash;how beautifully you express
yourself; such language only comes to the
good and clever&mdash;what line of action do you
advise me to adopt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, I must ask you, as between ourselves,
to enlighten me as to Mr. Pelham. I
know that you are still keeping up an
intimacy with your infamous lover, but I
must have it from your own lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that you may not have cause to
reproach yourself afterwards, if you should
happen to find out that I am not so bad as
you believe me to be! Yes, I will confess;
I will not attempt to deceive you. He still
holds his power over me, but you are not
entirely right in the way you put it. You
<em>are</em> in calling him infamous, but you are
wrong when you call him my lover. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
not so bad as that; but I cannot escape from
him. Why,&rdquo; she said, and her voice sank to
a whisper, &ldquo;do you know that I have to
supply him with money, that he lives upon
me, and that he has so entangled and
deceived me that I should laugh if I were to
see him lying dead at my feet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I require of you is this,&rdquo; I said,
not attempting to follow her into the currents
to which her strange utterances would lead
me. &ldquo;You will write down a full confession
of all matters relating to yourself which affect
the honour of my father. The confession
must be full and complete, and you will place
it in my hands, and leave the house, and
within a week afterwards you will leave the
country. You will pledge yourself never to
set foot again in England, and never to
attempt to see or speak with my father. In
return I will secure to you an income which
shall be paid to you regularly, so long as
you do not break the conditions of the contract.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How hard!&rdquo; she said, plaintively. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
am so fond of England! There is no other
country in the world worth living in. And
I have grown so attached to this house! I
am so happy here, so very, very happy! I
must think a little&mdash;you will not mind, will
you? And you will forgive me if I say
anything wrong! Even if there was what
you call an open exposure, and your father
were to believe every word you speak against
me, I am still his wife, and he would be compelled
to make me an allowance. Then I
could live where I please. These things come
to my mind, I suppose, because I have not a
soul in the world to help me&mdash;not a soul, not
a friend! Do you not see that I am speaking
reasonably?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Were the
affair made public, my father would adopt his
own course. He can be stern as well as
tender, and were his name dragged into the
mud because of his connection with you, it is
most likely he would institute an inquiry
which might bring to light circumstances
which you would rather should be hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
both from his knowledge and from the knowledge
of the world. You know best about
that; I am not so shallow-witted as to
suppose that I am acquainted with all the
particulars of your career; but I am on the
track, and the task of discovery would not be
difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are pitiless!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Sydney
Campbell would never have spoken to me as
you are speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His nature was different from mine, but
he was jealous of his honour, too. I wish
to make the position very clear to you.
Even were nothing worse than what is
already known to be discovered against
you, and my father consented to make
you an allowance&mdash;of which I am not at all
sure&mdash;it would not be as large as that I am
prepared to secure to you. That aspect of
the matter is worth your consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much a year do you propose?&rdquo; she
asked, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not less than a thousand a year. I will
undertake that my father shall make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that, or even a larger allowance, upon the conditions
I have stated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my confession am I to relate <em>all</em> that
passed between Sydney Campbell and myself?
You think I did not love him. You are
mistaken. I loved him deeply, and had he
lived he would soon have been at my feet
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to omit nothing,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;my
father must know all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me so piteously that for a
moment a doubt intruded itself whether there
might not be circumstances in her history
with which I was unacquainted which, instead
of more strongly condemning her, might
entitle her to compassion; but too stern a
duty was before me to allow the doubt to
remain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will give me a few hours to decide,&rdquo;
she implored. &ldquo;The shock is so sudden! I
am at your mercy. Grant me a few hours&rsquo;
respite! You will not, you cannot refuse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no intention of refusing, but as if
overcome by her feelings, she seized my hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and pressed them to her lips and her eyes,
which were wet with tears. I was endeavouring
to release myself when the door opened,
and her maid appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want&mdash;what do you
want?&rdquo; cried my father&rsquo;s wife, as she flung
herself from me. &ldquo;How dare you come in
without knocking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knocked, madam,&rdquo; replied the maid,
&ldquo;but you could not have heard. I thought
you rang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not ring. Leave the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid retired, and we were once more
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you to till to-morrow,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and then there must be an end to this deception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There shall be&mdash;there shall be!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Oh, how I thank you! But I will
not wait till to-morrow. No&mdash;the sooner the
blow is struck, the sooner my sufferings will
be over. Your father is engaged out this
evening. He will not be home till eleven or
twelve. At ten I will tell you how I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
decided&mdash;perhaps by that time I may have
commenced my confession. It is just&mdash;I see
how just it is&mdash;that your father shall not
remain another night in ignorance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;at ten to-night.
Where shall I see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I shall not be able
to come down stairs. My strength is quite,
quite gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was decided, and I left her. I did
not see my father during the day, and at ten
o&rsquo;clock I presented myself at her door, and
knocked. There was no answer, and observing
that the door was partly open I gently
pushed it, and entered the room. My father&rsquo;s
wife was sitting with her back to me, reading.
As she did not appear to be aware of my
presence, I called to her. She started to her
feet, and turned to me. Then I saw, to my
surprise, that her hair was hanging down,
that her slippered feet were bare, and that
she wore a loose dressing gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Why do you
come to my room at such an hour in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
unexpected manner?&rdquo; And as she spoke she
pulled the bell violently.</p>

<p>Failing to understand the meaning of her
words, I stammered something about an
appointment, at which she laughed, then burst
into tears, crying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare me, oh spare me, and your father
from the shame! Confess that you have
spoken under the influence of a horrible
dream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What other words she uttered I do not
clearly remember; they referred vaguely to
the proposition I had made to her, and in the
midst of a passionate speech her maid entered
the room. She ran to the maid, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God you have come!&rdquo; And then
to me, &ldquo;Leave the room instantly, and never
let me look upon your face again! From my
lips, this very night, shall your father hear
an account of all that has passed between you
and me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid stood between me and her mistress,
and I deemed it prudent to take my
departure. I passed a sleepless night, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the inexplicable conduct of this woman
and of the shock the discovery of her infamy
would be to my father. I longed to be with
him to console him and comfort him, and I
waited impatiently for daylight. At eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning I jumped from bed,
glad that the weary night was over, and as I
began to dress, I heard a tap at the door. I
asked who was there, and was answered by a
servant, who said that my father desired me
to go to him in his study the moment I awoke.
I sent word that I would come immediately,
and dressing hastily I went to his room.</p>

<p>He was standing, with a sterner look upon
his face than I had ever seen. He was pale
and haggard, and it was evident that his night
had been as sleepless as mine. I was advancing
to him with a feeling of pity and sympathy,
when he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are. Do not move
another step towards me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We stood, gazing upon each other in silence
for a minute or two. Then I said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not slept, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not slept. When I left Mrs. Holdfast
last night, I came to my study, and have
been here all the night, waiting for daylight&mdash;and
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard bad news, sir,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard what I would have given
my fortune and my life had never been spoken.
It is incredible that one whom I loved should
bring dishonour upon my name and shame
into my house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I must pause for a moment or two.
When I commenced this statement I had no
idea that it would stretch out to its present
length, and so anxious am I that it should
reach you as early as possible that I will
shorten the description of what remains to be
told. Prepare to be shocked and amazed&mdash;as
I myself was shocked and amazed at the
revelation made to me that morning in my
father&rsquo;s study, on that last morning I ever
spent in his house. You think you know the
character of this woman who plays with men&rsquo;s
lives and honour as though they were toys to
amuse an idle hour. You do not yet comprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the depths of infamy to which such
a nature as hers can descend. Nor did I until
I left my father&rsquo;s house, never to return.</p>

<p>She had, as she declared she would, made a
confession to my father during the night;
it was not a confession of her own shameful
life, but an invention so horrible as almost, at
the time I heard it, to deprive me of the power
of speech. She accused me of playing the
lover to her; she described me as a profligate
of the vilest kind. She made my father
believe that from the moment I saw her I
filled her ears with protestations and proposals
which I should be ashamed to repeat to one
as pure and innocent as yourself. Day after
day, hour after hour, she had followed out the
plan she had devised to shut me from my
father&rsquo;s heart and deprive me of his love, and
so skilfully and artfully were all the details
guided by her wicked mind that, presented as
they were to my father with tears, and sobs,
and tremblings, he could scarcely avoid believing
in their truth. Twice on the previous
day&mdash;so her story ran&mdash;had I forced myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
into her private room; once in the morning
when my father was in his city office, and
again in the night when she was about to
retire to rest, and when I knew that my father
was not in the house. Unfortunately, as she
said, for she would have preferred that a
scandal so shameful should have no chance of
becoming public, her maid entered the room
on both occasions, and witnessed portions of
the scenes. In the morning, when her maid
intruded herself, she had dismissed her, and
thereafter implored me to leave her in peace.
In the evening I was so violent that she had
to seek protection from her maid. She called
the maid, who corroborated her in every particular;
and she produced other evidence
against me in the shape of the locket I had
worn on my chain. When she handed this
locket to my father it contained a portrait of
myself&mdash;a small head carefully cut from a
photograph&mdash;and she declared that I had
forced the likeness upon her, and had insisted
upon her wearing it. She said that she had
endeavoured by every means in her power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
wean me from my guilty passion; that a dozen
times she had been on the point of exposing
me to her husband, but had always been prevented
by a feeling of tenderness for him and
by a hope, which grew fainter and fainter
every day, that I might awake from my folly;
that no woman had ever been subjected to
such cruel persecution and had ever suffered
so much as she had; and that, at length, unable
to keep the horrible secret to herself, she
had resolved to impart it to her husband, and
throw herself upon his protection.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. I had threatened, if she
would not receive me as her lover, that I
would bring the most shameful charges
against her, and by the aid of bribed assistants,
whom I should call as witnesses, blast
her reputation and ruin her happiness. The
very words I had used to her in our interview
on the previous day were repeated to me by
my father, so artfully twisted as to render
them powerless against herself and conclusive
against me.</p>

<p>From this brief description you will be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to form some idea of the position in which I
was placed during this interview with my
father. I was allowed no opportunity of
defence. My father&rsquo;s wife had contrived to
rouse to its utmost pitch the chivalry of his
nature in her behalf. I doubt whether my
father at that time would have received any
evidence, however conclusive, against her,
and whether, in the peculiar frame of mind
into which she had worked him he would not
have accepted every proof of her guilt as
proof of her virtue.</p>

<p>His recital of his wife&rsquo;s wrongs being at an
end, he addressed himself to me in terms so
violent, so unfatherly, so unjust, that I lost my
self-command. Such a scene as followed is
rare, I hope, between father and son. He discarded
me; he swore he would never look
upon me as a son; would never think of me;
would never receive me. He forbade me ever
to address or refer to him; he banished me
from his house and his heart; he flung money
at me, as he would have done at a beggar; he
was in every way so insulting that my feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as a man overcame my duty as a son; and we
used such words to each other as men can
scarcely ever forget or forgive. To such
extremes and opposites can a false woman
drive men ordinarily just, and kind, and temperate.</p>

<p>The scene ended thus. I repudiated my
father as he repudiated me; I trampled his
money under my feet; I told him that he
would one day awake from his dream; and I
swore that never, until he asked my forgiveness,
would I use or acknowledge the name of
Holdfast, which he, and not I, was dishonouring.
He held me to my oath; in a fit of fury
he produced a Bible, and bade me repeat it.
I did so solemnly, and I kissed the sacred
Book. He threw the door open wide, and
pointed sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I turn you from my
house. You and I have done with each other
for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went in silence, and as the sound of the
shutting of the street door fell upon my ears,
I felt as if I had cut myself from myself. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
walked into the streets a forlorn and lonely
man, with no name, no past, no friend. I did
not meet any person who knew me; I called
a cab, and drove to a remote part of London,
where I hired a room in a common lodging-house.
But I had not been there an hour
before I discovered myself to be a mark for
observation. My clothes, perhaps my manner,
betrayed me. I left the house, and strolled
into a railway station. I could not feel
myself safe until I was in a place where I was
utterly unknown and entirely free. Standing
before a railway time-bill, the first name that
attracted me was Exeter. The train was to
start in half-an-hour, and I bought my ticket.
Thus it was that, by a mere accident, I journeyed
to the town in which I was to meet and
love you. On my way I decided upon the
name I would assume. Frederick was common
enough, and I retained it; I added to it the
name of Maitland. On my way, also, I reviewed
my circumstances, and decided upon
my plan of action. I had in money, saved
from my father&rsquo;s liberal allowance while I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
at Oxford, nearly four hundred pounds.
Business I did not understand, and was not fit
for. I was competent to undertake the duties
of a tutor. I determined to look out for such
a situation, either in England or abroad, but
on no account in any family likely to reside
in London or Oxford. In Exeter I employed
myself, for a few weeks, in writing for the
press. I obtained introduction to a gentleman
who occupied the position of editor
of a small local newspaper, and him I assisted.
I did not ask for pay, nor did I receive
any. I was glad of any occupation to
distract my thoughts. Through this friend I
heard of a situation likely to suit me. A
gentleman wanted a tutor for his son, whose
ill-health compelled him to be much at home.
I applied for the situation, and obtained it.
In that family you were also employed, as
music teacher, and thus you and I became
acquainted.</p>

<p>With the gentleman who employed me,
or with his family, I could not become
familiar; there was nothing in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
between us. With you it was different; I
was interested in you, and soon learned that
you lived with a sick mother, of whom you
were the sole support, and that you were a
lady. There is no need for me to dwell upon
the commencement and continuation of a
friendship, which began in respect and mutual
esteem, and ended in love. You were poor;
I was comparatively rich; and I am afraid
my dear, that during the first few weeks I led
you to believe that my circumstances were
better than they really were. That is the
usual effect produced by an extravagant
nature. I paid court to you, and we engaged
ourselves to each other. Then I began to
take a more serious view of life. I had a dear
one to work for; there was no prospect open
to me in England; and the mystery in which
I was compelled to shroud myself, coupled
with the fact that London and other places in
my native country were closed to me, caused
me to turn my thoughts to America. In that
new land I could make a home for you; in
that new land, with but moderate good fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
we might settle and live a happy life.
Your mother and yourself were contented
with the plan, and encouraged me in it. So
I threw up my situation, bade you good-bye,
and left for the wonderful country which one
day is to rule the world. Before my departure
I wrote to my father. Except upon the
envelope I did not address him by his name.
I simply told him that I was quitting England,
that I had kept and would keep my oath, and
that if he desired to write to me at any time
he could send his letter to the New York Post
Office.</p>

<p>You are acquainted with the worldly result
of my visit to America; you know that I was
not successful. Unable to obtain profitable
employment in New York, I went to Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington, and some
smaller towns and cities. It was my misfortune
that I could not quickly assimilate myself
with the new ways and modes of American
life, and my ill-luck sprang more from myself
than from the land in which I wished to establish
myself. I was absent from New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
for nearly five months. In despair I returned
to it, and my first visit was paid to the General
Post Office. Your letters were sent to me
from time to time in accordance with the
directions I gave you when I wrote to you,
and were sent to the name of Frederick Maitland.
It was almost with an air of guilt that
I inquired at the New York Post Office
whether there were any letters for Frederick
Holdfast. I had no expectation of receiving
any, and I was therefore astonished when
three were handed to me. They were in the
handwriting of my father. I did not tell you
at the time, but it is a fact that I was in a
desperate condition. My clothes were shabby,
my pockets were empty. My joy and agitation
at the receipt of these three letters
were very great. I had never ceased
to love my father, and tears rushed to my
eyes at the sight of his handwriting. I knew,
which he did not at the time we parted, that
we were both the victims of a clever, scheming,
beautiful woman. Would these letters
lead to a reconciliation? I tore them open.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
They bore one address, an hotel in New York.
Then my father was in America! The last
letter, however, was dated two months back.
Quickly I made myself acquainted with the
contents.</p>

<p>They were all written in the same strain.
My father had come to America to see me.
The refrain was as follows: &ldquo;I am distressed
and unhappy. Come to me at once.&rdquo; What
had happened? Had he discovered the
treachery of the woman who had parted
us, and was anxious for a reconciliation
with me? Yes, surely the latter; I could
not mistake the tone of his communications,
although they commenced with &ldquo;My son,&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;My dear Son.&rdquo; Explanations
between us were necessary, and then all
would be right. Eagerly I sought the hotel
from which the letters were addressed, and
easily found it. I inquired for Mr. Holdfast;
he was not in the hotel; his name was
known, and the books were consulted. He
had left the hotel six weeks before. &ldquo;Has he
gone to another hotel?&rdquo; I asked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
manager replied that Mr. Holdfast had informed
him that while he was in New York
he should stop at no other hotel. &ldquo;He
seemed,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;to be anxiously
expecting a friend who never came, for he
was very particular in obtaining a description
of every gentleman who called during his
absence. He is not in New York at present,
you may be sure of that.&rdquo; I asked if it were
likely I could obtain information of him at
any other place in the city, but the hotel
manager could not give me an address at
which I could make an inquiry. Disheartened
I turned away, and wandered
disconsolately through the city. I sauntered
through Broadway, in the direction of the
City Hall and Wall Street, and paused before
the <cite>Herald</cite> Office, outside of which a copy of
the paper was posted. I ran my eye down
the columns, and lingered over the &ldquo;Personals,&rdquo;
in the vague hope that I should see
my name there. I did not see my name, but
a mist came into my eyes, and my heart beat
violently as I saw an advertisement to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the initials F.&nbsp;H. were attached. F.&nbsp;H.&mdash;Frederick
Holdfast. My own name! The
advertisement was for me, and read thus:
&ldquo;F.&nbsp;H.&mdash;Follow me immediately to Chicago.
Inquire at the Brigg&rsquo;s House.&rdquo; From that
advertisement I inferred that my father was
in Chicago, and that, if I could start for
that city at once, I should meet him. But
my pockets, as I have said, were empty.
Between twenty and thirty dollars were
required to carry me to Chicago, which I
could reach in thirty-six hours. I had no
money, but I had a souvenir of Sydney&rsquo;s,
a ring which he gave me in our happy
days, and which I had inwardly vowed
never to part with. However, there was
no help for it now; it must go. I should
be able to redeem it by-and-bye; so I
pawned it for thirty dollars, and took the
night train to Chicago. How happy I
was! Not only the coming reconciliation
with my father, but, after that, the certainty
of being able to provide a home for you,
cheered my heart. Then I could assume my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
own name; my father would speak the words
which would remove from my conscience the
obligation of the sacred oath I had sworn. I
scarcely slept or ate on the weary journey,
my impatience was so great. But long
before we reached the end of our journey we
were appalled by news of a dreadful nature.
Chicago was in flames. At every stage the
intelligence became more alarming. The
flames were spreading, not from house to
house, but from street to street; the entire
city was on fire. And the Brigg&rsquo;s House and
my father? God forgive me! So selfish are
we in our troubles and in our joys, that I
thought of no other house but the Brigg&rsquo;s
House, of no other human being but my
father. The news travelled so fast towards
us, as we travelled towards the
conflagration, that I soon learned that the
street in which Brigg&rsquo;s House was situated
had caught, and that every building in it
was burnt to the ground. &ldquo;Any lives
lost?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thousands!&rdquo; An exaggeration,
as we afterwards found, but we did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
stop to doubt; instead of lessening the
extent of the calamity, our fears exaggerated
it. O, how I prayed and prayed!
It was a dreadful time, and it was almost a
relief when the evidence of our own senses
was enlisted in confirmation of the news.
The skies in the distance were lurid red, and
imagination added to the terror of the
knowledge that families were being ruined,
hopes destroyed, ambitions blasted, and hearts
tortured in the flames reflected in the clouds.
Our train stopped, and miles of fire lay within
our sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="sbt2">FREDERICK HOLDFAST&rsquo;S STATEMENT (CONCLUDED).</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Under</span> these circumstances the obstacles
before me became almost insurmountable.
The residents of the burning city were
in a state of the wildest confusion, and my
anxious inquiries for my father were fruitless;
I could obtain no news of him; not a person
to whom I spoke, not even those connected
with the hotel, could inform me whether a
gentleman named Holdfast, or one answering
to my description of him, had stopped at the
Briggs&rsquo; House.</p>

<p>I was perplexed how to act, but an idea
that it would be well for me to remain upon
the spot, on the chance that I might yet learn
something of my father, caused me to resolve
not to leave Chicago for awhile. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
resolution I was pledged by my necessities.
I was penniless, and to return immediately
to New York was a matter of impossibility.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in obtaining sufficient to
live upon from day to day. Assistance and
food poured into the city from all parts of
the States, and already upon the burning
ruins men were beginning to rebuild their
stores and houses. Every pair of hands was
valuable, and I worked with the rest, never
for a moment losing sight of the vital mission
upon which I was engaged. For a month I
remained in Chicago, and having by that
time earned enough money to carry me
to New York, and being also satisfied
that I had exhausted every channel open
to me through which I might hear of or
from my father, I took the train back,
and in thirty-six hours reached the hotel
in New York from which my father had
addressed his letters to me. It appeared
as if I had taken the right step, for on the
very day of my arrival I saw among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
&ldquo;Personals&rdquo; in the <cite>New York Herald</cite> the
following advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;F.H.&mdash;The day before you leave America
for England advertise in the <cite>Herald&rsquo;s</cite> Personal
column the name of the ship in which you
have taken your passage. It is of the utmost
importance. Implicit silence until we meet.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Mysterious as was this communication, it
afforded me satisfaction. My father, doubtless,
had his own good reasons for the course
he was pursuing, but it hurt me that he had
not, by a few words which I alone could have
understood, removed from me the obligation
entailed upon me by my solemn oath to pass
myself off under a false name. Until he asked
my forgiveness, or acknowledged his error, I
could not resume my own.</p>

<p>I entered the hotel, and there another
surprise awaited me. My father had, during
my absence in Chicago, lived at the hotel for
nearly a fortnight. In an interview with the
manager, I was informed that the description
my father had received of my personal appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had much excited him. &ldquo;I could
not give him your name,&rdquo; said the manager,
&ldquo;as you did not leave any. He made
inquiries for you everywhere, and employed
detectives to discover you, but they were not
successful. He appeared as anxious to see
you as you were to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been to Chicago, has he not?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;He was there at the time of the
fire, and stopped at the Briggs&rsquo; House?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge,&rdquo; replied the
manager. &ldquo;He has not spoken of it; and it
is one of the things a man <em>would</em> speak of.
Such a scene as that!&mdash;and the Briggs&rsquo; House
burnt to the ground, too! No, I don&rsquo;t think
Mr. Holdfast went to Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no comment upon this; doubtless
my father did not wish his movements to be
too widely known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Holdfast now?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very near Liverpool,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;He left in the Germanic this day week.
There is a letter in the office for you which I
was to deliver into your hands in case you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
called. No one else could do so, as you see
no name is on the envelope, and as no other
person but myself could identify you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter informed me that my father was
returning to England, and I was desired to
follow him immediately. To enable me to do
this he enclosed Bank of England notes for
£200, and in addition a draft for £500 payable
at sight to bearer at a bank in London.
The concluding words of the letter were
&ldquo;Upon your arrival in Liverpool go to the
Post-office there, where a letter will await
you, instructing you how to proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Made happy by this communication, but
still more than ever impressed by the consciousness
that a mystery existed which
rendered it necessary to be cautious, I thanked
the manager of the hotel, and hastened to a
shipping office in Broadway, where I paid my
passage in a steamer which was to leave in a
couple of days. Then I went to the <cite>Herald</cite>
office, and paid for an advertisement in the
Personal column, giving the name of the ship
in which I had taken passage, and the date of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
its departure. Before the expiration of two
weeks I landed in Liverpool, and applied at
the Post Office for a letter. One was handed
to me in the handwriting of my father.
Imagine my astonishment at its contents. So
as to make this statement in a certain measure
complete, I will endeavour to recall what it
contained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Frederick, and whatever other name you
choose to call yourself by. In sending you to
Chicago, and causing you to follow me back
to England, I have had but one motive&mdash;to
impress upon you that you cannot escape the
consequences of your slander upon the
noblest woman breathing. In whatever part
of the world you may be, my hate and curse
shall follow you. Now, present yourself
before me and beg upon your knees for
mercy and forgiveness; it will be another
proof of your currish spirit! I shall know
how to receive you, Slanderer!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>I could scarcely believe the evidence of
my senses. I trembled with amazement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
indignation. That such a trick should have
been played upon me was altogether so
astonishing and incomprehensible that I
looked about me in bewilderment for a
faithful heart upon whose sympathy I could
throw myself for consolation. I thought of
you, and determined to come to you, and
ask for counsel and comfort. But before I
started for Exeter there was something to do
which, to leave undone, would have brought
a life-long shame upon me. I took from
the money remaining of the £200 I received
in New York as much as would carry me to
your side; the rest I enclosed in an envelope,
with the sight draft for £500, and sent it to
my father&rsquo;s address in London, with these
words: &ldquo;May God pardon you for the wrong
you have done me! I will never seek you,
nor, if you seek me, will I ever come to you.
The money I have spent of the £200 I will
endeavour to repay you; but what else,
besides money, we owe to each other can
never be repaid in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I posted this letter, and journeyed on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Exeter, and there another grief awaited me.
You had left the town; your mother was
dead, had been dead for weeks, and you had
not informed me of it in your letters. I will
be frank with you. So overwhelmed was I
by what had taken place, so much was my
spirit bruised, that it seemed as if faith in
human kind had entirely deserted me. For
a moment, my dear, I doubted even you;
but then the better and truer hope dawned
upon me that, knowing from my letters how
unfortunate and unhappy I had been, you
had withheld from me the news of your own
deep trouble so that it might not add to
mine.</p>

<p>What now was I to do? All that I could
learn of you was that you had gone to
London; there, then, was my duty. To
London I must go, and endeavour to find
you, and endeavour at the same time to hide
myself from my father who had so shamefully
abused me. But I had no money&mdash;not a
shilling. I could raise a little, however.
Before I left New York I had provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
myself with good clothes, and these were on
me now. I went to a vile shop in one of
the worst parts of Exeter, and there I bartered
the clothes I stood upright in for a sum of
money barely sufficient to take me to London
and to enable me to live there on dry bread
for a few days. Included in this bargain, to
my necessity and advantage, was a ragged
suit of clothes in which I dressed, after
divesting myself of my better habiliments,
and thus, clothed like a beggar, and with
a despairing heart beating in my bosom, I
made my way to London. At the end of a
week I had not a penny left, and I was so
hungry that I had to beg for bread of a
girl standing at the wooden gate of a poor-looking
house.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart was touched&mdash;God bless
her for it!&mdash;and she ran into the house, and
brought out a few pieces of stale bread and
cheese, wrapped in a bit of newspaper. I
stood by a lamp-post, munching the hard
bread, and looking at the bit of newspaper
the while. What I read related to a mysterious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
fearful murder which had been
committed in Great Porter Square. Nothing
was known of the murdered man, and his
murderer had not been discovered. The
names of both were shrouded in mystery.
&ldquo;So might it be with me,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;if I
were murdered this night, there is about me
or upon me absolutely no mark or sign by
which I could be identified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, my dear, London&rsquo;s mysteries are many
and terrible! Imagination cannot compass
or excel them.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, and I wandered aimlessly
through the streets, saving some of the
bread for my supper later on. The hopelessness
of the task before me, that of discovering
you, filled me with a deeper despair. It was
as though I were shut out from all sympathy
with my kind. By what I now believe to be
a kind of fate, I wandered, without knowing
the direction I was taking, towards Great
Porter Square. I came to the Square itself,
and looked up at the name in the endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to read it. &ldquo;Are you looking for Great
Porter Square?&rdquo; asked a woman who was
passing by. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;where the murder
was committed.&rdquo; Well, it in no way
concerned me. A man was murdered there.
What of it? He was out of his misery. That
was the substance of my reflections. He was
out of his misery, as I wished I was out of
mine. For the minutes were hours, every
one of which deepened my despair. I
worked myself into a condition so morbid
and utterly wretched that I gave up all
hope of finding you. I had no place to lie
in that night, and on the previous night I
had slept in the open. The morning light
would shine upon me, penniless, starving,
and so woe-begone as to be a mark for men.
I began to think I had had enough of life.
And all the while these gloomy thoughts
were driving me to the lowest depths I
continued to walk round and about the
thoroughfares of the Square in which the
murder had been committed. After a time,
the consciousness of this forced itself upon
me, and the idea entered my mind that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
would go into the Square itself, and look at
the house. I followed out my idea, and
walked slowly round the Square until I came
to No.&nbsp;119. I lingered before it for a
moment or two, and then walked the entire
circuit; and as I did so another suggestion
presented itself. From the appearance of
the house I judged it to be deserted. If I
could gain admittance I should have, at least,
a shelter from the night for a few hours; if
there were a bed in it I should have a bed;
the circumstance of the murder having been
committed there had no real terrors for me.
I had arrived at this mental stage when I
found myself once more before the house;
I was munching some bread at the time. I
ascended the steps and tried the street door,
and as I laid my hand upon the handle a
policeman came up to me and endeavoured
to seize me. A sudden terror fell upon me,
and I shook him off roughly, and flew as
though I were flying for my life; and, as I
have already described to you, as I flew, the
fancy crept upon me that my presence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Square, my trying the door, and now my
flight, had brought me into deadly peril in
connection with the murder. I heard the
policeman running after me. He sprang his
rattle; the air seemed filled with pursuing
enemies hunting me down, and I flew the
faster, but only to fall at last, quite exhausted,
into the arms of men, in whose remarks I
heard a confirmation of my fears. Then I
became cooler, and was marched to a police
station, mocking myself as it were in a
temper of devilish taunting despair, to be
accused of a crime of which no man living
was more innocent. When I was asked for
my name by the inspector I did not immediately
answer. My own name I dared
not give; nor could I give the name by
which you knew me. I would endeavour to
keep my disgrace from your knowledge; so
I gave a false name, the first that occurred to
me, Antony Cowlrick, and gave it in such a
way that the police knew it to be false.
After that, I was thrown into a cell, where
in solitude I might repent of my crimes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
misdeeds. So bitter was my mood that I
resolved to keep my tongue silent and say
no word about myself. I knew that I was
an innocent man, and I looked forward somewhat
curiously to learn by what villainous
and skilful means my accusers could bring
the crime of murder home to me.</p>

<p>I pass over the dismal weeks of my farce
of a trial, and I come to our meeting in
Leicester Square.</p>

<p>It was my first gleam of sunshine for many
a week, but another was to warm me during
the day. With you by my side my strength
of mind, my hope returned. The only money
I had was the sovereign lent to me by the
Special Reporter of the &ldquo;Evening Moon;&rdquo;
you were poorer than I, and had, when we
so happily met, exhausted your resources.
The very engagement ring I gave you had
been pawned to enable you to live. Money
was necessary. How could I obtain it? Could
I not apply to one of my former friends?
I ran over in my mind the list of those
whose people lived in London, and I paused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
at the name of Adolph, who had played so
memorable a part in the Sydney Campbell
tragedy. His parents lived in London, and
were wealthy. If Adolph were home I would
appeal to him, and solicit help from him.
We drove to his father&rsquo;s house, stopping on
the way at a barber&rsquo;s, by whose aid I made
myself more presentable. Adolph was in
London, and luckily at home. I sent up my
name, and he came to me, and wished me to
enter the house, and be introduced to his
people; but I pointed to my clothes and
refused. He accompanied me from his house,
and when we were in a secluded spot I told
him my story under a pledge of secrecy. He
has a good heart, and he expressed himself
as owing me a debt of gratitude which he
should never be able to repay. I pointed
out to him how he could repay me, and the
generous-hearted lad gave me not only a
hundred pounds, but a bill, long-dated, which
a money-lender discounted for me, and which
placed me in possession of a comparatively
large sum of money. I hope to be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
pay this debt. I think I shall be, in the
course of time.</p>

<p>But Adolph served me in more ways than
one, and in a way neither he nor I could have
dreamt of. The money-lender he recommended
me to go to lived in the City, and
to reach his office I had to pass my father&rsquo;s
place of business. I drove there in a four-wheeled
cab, and to avoid notice I kept the
windows up. But as I passed my father&rsquo;s
City house I could not help looking towards
it, and I was surprised to find it closed. My
own name did not appear upon the bill, and
the money-lender and I were strangers to each
other. I did not hesitate, therefore, when
our business was concluded, to inquire if he
knew Mr. Holdfast, and he replied that the
name was well-known in the City. I then inquired
why his place of business was closed,
and received, in answer, the unexpected information
that my father was in America, and
had been there for many months. Upon this,
I said in a careless tone, as though it were
a matter in which I was but slightly interested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that I had heard that Mr. Holdfast had returned
from America two or three months ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;Mr. Holdfast
had not yet come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This set me thinking, and added another
link to the mystery and sorrow of my life. I
determined to assure myself whether my father
was really in London, and on the following
day I sent to his house, by a confidential
messenger, an envelope. It was simply a test
of the money-lender&rsquo;s statement. The
messenger returned to me with the envelope
unopened, and with the information that my
father was in America. &ldquo;I inquired of the
workpeople,&rdquo; said my messenger, &ldquo;and was
told that Mr. Holdfast had not been seen
in the neighbourhood for quite half a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What conclusion was I to draw from this
startling disclosure? My father, returning
to England in the Germanic, had never been
heard of either at his house of business or at
his home? What, then, had become of him?
What motive had he for mysterious concealment?
Arguing, as I believed to be the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
when I received the first letter from him in
New York, that he had discovered the infamous
character of the woman he had made
his wife, there <em>was</em> perhaps a motive for his
not living in the house to which he had
brought her; but it was surely reasonable
to expect that his return would be known
at his place of business. I reflected upon the
nature and character of my father&rsquo;s wife, and
upon the character of her scheming lover,
Mr. Pelham; I subjected them to a mental
analysis of the most searching kind, and I
could arrive at but one conclusion&mdash;Foul
Play! Judging from what had occurred
between them and my poor friend, Sydney
Campbell, there was no plot too treacherous
for them to engage in, no scheme too wicked
for them to devise and carry out. Foul Play
rose before me in a thousand hideous shapes,
until in its many-sided mental guise it became
a conviction so strong that I did not pause to
doubt it. Then arose another phase of the
affair. If there had been Foul Play with my
father, was it not reasonable to suppose that I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
also, had been made the victim of clever
tricksters? This, too, in a vague inexplicable
way, became a conviction. A number of conflicting
circumstances at once occurred to me
in confirmation. The advertisement in the
<cite>New York Herald</cite> desiring me to proceed to
Chicago attached itself to the statement of the
manager of the hotel at which my father
stopped that Mr. Holdfast had not been in
Chicago. The second advertisement in the
&ldquo;Personal&rdquo; column of the <cite>Herald</cite> desiring me
to advertise the name of the ship I took
passage in from New York to Liverpool,
attached itself to the circumstance that my
father&rsquo;s letter, handed to me by the hotel
manager, contained no wish to know what
ship I sailed in. And upon this came the
thought that at the time this last &ldquo;Personal,&rdquo;
which I supposed was inserted by my father,
appeared in the columns of the <cite>Herald</cite>, my
father was on the Atlantic. Fool that I was
to act without deliberation, to believe without
questioning. Last of all, the conflicting tone
of the two letters I received from my father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the one in New York, which was undoubtedly
genuine, and the one from the Liverpool post
office, which may have been forged!&mdash;This
completed it. Conviction seemed added to
conviction, confirmation to confirmation,
doubt to doubt&mdash;although every point in the
evidence was circumstantial, and, nothing
as yet could be distinctly proved. How I regretted
that I had not kept the letters! When
I received the last in Liverpool, I tore up, in a
fury of indignation, every letter my father
had written to me, and had therefore no
writing of his in my possession by which I
could compare and judge. I find now, that
it is too late, that there is no wisdom in haste.</p>

<p>It weighed heavily upon me, as a duty not
to be avoided, to endeavour to ascertain
whether my father arrived in the Germanic,
and after that what had become of him. And
with the consciousness of this unmistakable
duty arose the memory of so many acts of
tenderness and kindness from my father to
myself, that I began to accuse myself of injustice
towards him, and to believe that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was not he who had wronged me, but I who
had wronged him. With this grievous thought
in my mind, I left you, and proceeded to
Liverpool.</p>

<p>My first visit was paid to the office of the
White Star Line. There I learned that my
father had taken passage in New York on
the date I gave, that the Germanic arrived in
Liverpool after a rapid passage of little more
than eight days, that no casualty occurred
on the voyage, and that there was no doubt
that my father landed with the other passengers.
This point was settled by the books of
the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. My father
had stopped there for six days, and his name
was duly recorded. Another point, quite as
important, was established by reference to
the hotel books and by inquiring of persons
employed in the hotel. When my father left
Liverpool, he took train to London. I had
arrived at this stage of my inquiries, and
was debating on the next step to take, when
my attention was attracted by the cries of the
newspaper street boys, calling out at the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of their voices, fresh discoveries in the
<cite>Evening Moon</cite> respecting the murder in Great
Porter Square. With no suspicion of the
awful disclosure which awaited me, but
naturally interested in any new phase of the
mysterious incident, I purchased the paper
and looked at the headings of the Supplement,
and, casually at the matter. Seeing my own
name&mdash;the name of Holdfast&mdash;repeated over
and over again in the paper, I hurried from
the street to the solitude of my room, and
there read the most wicked, monstrous, and
lying romance that human minds ever invented.
And in addition to the horrible
calumnies which that &ldquo;Romance of Real Life&rdquo;
contains in its references to me, I learned, to
my unutterable grief, that the man who was
so foully murdered in Great Porter Square
was my own father.</p>

<p>My dear, for many minutes the terrible disclosure&mdash;the
knowledge that my dear father
had met his death in a manner so awful and
mysterious, took such complete possession of
my mind that I had no thought of myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
My father was dead! The last time we met
we parted in anger, using words to each other
such as bitter enemies would use. I swore in
his presence that he was dishonouring the
name of Holdfast, and that I would never use
it until he asked my forgiveness for the cruel
injustice he had done me; and he drove me
from his heart and from his house. My forgiveness
he could never ask for now; he
was dead! And the wrong we each did to
the other in that hot encounter, in which
love was poisoned by a treacherous wanton&rsquo;s
scheming, could never be repaired until we
met in another world. I wept bitter tears,
and falling on my knees&mdash;my mind enlightened
by the strange utterances of a worthless
woman, as reported in the <cite>Evening Moon</cite>&mdash;I
asked my father&rsquo;s forgiveness, as I had warned
him to ask mine. And yet, my dear, neither
of us was wrong; he was right and I was
right; and if the question between us were
put to a high and worthy test, it would be
found that we both were animated by impulses
which, under other circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
would have been an honour to our manhood.</p>

<p>But these kindly feelings passed away in the
indignation which a sense of monstrous injustice
inspired. To see my name so blackened, so
defamed, my character so outraged and malformed,
inflamed me for a time to a pitch of
fury which threatened to cloud my judgment
and my reason. What brought me to my
senses? My love for you. I should have
been reckless had I only myself to protect, to
provide for; but a dearer self than myself
depended upon me, and my honour was
engaged to you. It was due to you that I
should clear myself of these charges. Herein,
my dear, came home to me, in the most
forcible manner in which it could have
been presented, the value of responsibilities.
They tend to check our selfish impulses, and
to indicate to us our line of action&mdash;straight
on.</p>

<p>At this time I had written to you my half-disapproval
of the step you had taken in disguising
yourself as a maid-of-all-work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
obtaining a situation next to that in Great
Porter Square in which the murder had been
committed&mdash;Great God! I cannot write it
with calmness&mdash;the murder of my father.
But after I had read the Romance in Real
Life in the <cite>Evening Moon</cite> and had somewhat
calmed myself, I seemed to see in your action
a kind of Providence. Before these insanely-wicked
inventions of my father&rsquo;s widow were
made public, before it was known that the
man who was murdered in Great Porter
Square was my father, it was comparatively
unimportant that I should be cleared of a
charge of which I was innocent; it was then,
so to speak, a side issue; now it is a vital
issue. And the murderer must be discovered.
I say it solemnly&mdash;<em>must</em> be discovered! He
will be. Not by the Government, nor by the
police, nor by any judicial agency, but by one
whose honour, whose future, whose faith and
love, are dragged into this dread crisis. And
I see that it will be so&mdash;I see that you have
been guided by a higher than a human
impulse in your love-directed and seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
mad inspiration to transform and degrade
yourself, for the purpose of clearing me from
a wicked and cruel accusation. At one time
I doubted whether truth and justice were
more than words; I doubt no longer;
reflecting over certain incidents and accidents&mdash;accidents
as I believed them to be&mdash;I see
that something more than chance directed
them, and that of our own destinies we ourselves
are not the sole arbiters.</p>

<p>In the extraordinary narration presented to
the readers of the <cite>Evening Moon</cite> I read that I
am dead. Well, be it so. How the falsehood
was invented, and led up to, and strengthened
by newspaper evidence, scarcely interests me
in the light of the more momentous issue
which affects my future and yours. Involved
in it, undoubtedly, were wonderful inventive
powers, much painstaking, and immense
industry&mdash;the result of which was a newspaper
paragraph of a few lines, every word of
which is false. That the woman who <em>was</em> my
father&rsquo;s wife, that the man who <em>is</em> her lover,
believe that I am dead, appears to be beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
doubt. Let them continue in their belief
until their guilt is brought home to them. To
all intents and purposes, to all useful ends at
present in the service of truth and justice, it
will be best that it should be believed that I
<em>am</em> dead. So let it be, then, until the
proper time comes. It will come, I believe
and hope.</p>

<p>To one end I am pledged. I will avenge
my father&rsquo;s murder, if it is in my power.
I will bring his murderer to justice, if it is in
my power. Help me if you can, and if after
you peruse this strange narrative, every word
of which is as faithful and true as though an
angel, instead of an erring mortal, wrote it,
you can still believe in me, still have faith in
me, I shall bless you all my life, as I shall
love you all my life, whether you remain
faithful to me or not.</p>

<p>To my own heart, buoyed as I am with
hope, stricken down as I am with despair, it
seems treason to me to doubt; but all belief
and faith, human and divine, would fall into
a dark and hopeless abyss if it did not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
some image, human or divine, to cling to; and
I cling to you! You are my hope and my
anchor!</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe, as dimly I
comprehend it now, the character of the
woman who has brought all this misery upon
me. She is fair and beautiful to look upon;
innocence appears to dwell in her face; her
eyes meet yours frankly and smilingly; her
manners are the manners of a child; her
voice is as sweet as the voice of a child.
Were she and I to appear before a human
tribunal, accused of a crime of which she was
guilty and I innocent, she would be acquitted
and I condemned.</p>

<p>I am in your hands. Judge me quickly.
If you delay, and say, &ldquo;My faith is not
shaken,&rdquo; I am afraid I should not be satisfied,
because of your delay. In hope, as in
despair,</p>

<p class="sbt2">BECKY&rsquo;S REPLY TO HER LOVER&rsquo;S STATEMENT.</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">My</span> <span class="smcap">Dearest</span>,&mdash;It is now very near morning,
within an hour of the time I am expected
to rise. I have been up all night, and
having read the story of your life from
beginning to end, have re-read some portions
again and again, so that they shall be fixed
permanently in my mind. How I love and
pity you! To say, as you desire me to say,
that my faith is not shaken, is but a poor
expression of my feelings towards you.
My faith is strengthened, my love is
strengthened, my hope is strengthened.
Sitting in my little cupboard of a bedroom,
with Fanny sleeping peacefully in my
bed&mdash;yes, my dear, my poor little friend is
with me again; I found her, the night
before last, fainting for food at the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
door of No.&nbsp;119&mdash;sitting here, in the presence
of that poor human waif, with my candle
nearly burnt out, and the dim light of morning
just beginning to dawn, it seems to me as if
a star is shining upon me, instilling into
my heart a wonderful faith and courage.</p>

<p>I am not tired, but that may be because of
my excitement and exaltation. I intend to
be careful and prudent. When the housework
is done, I shall take some rest. I might
have a little now, but that I can turn my
thoughts to nothing until I write to you what
is in my mind. My faith is not shaken; I
repeat it; and I add, let not your faith be
shaken. Whatever occurs, do not for a
moment doubt me, do not for a moment lose
faith in me. You say that I must have been
guided by a higher than a human impulse
when I took the strange step of transforming
myself into a servant-of-all-work, and seeking
service with Mrs. Preedy, in the house next to
that in which your dear father was murdered.
Do you remember my telling you in my first
letter that an inspiration had fallen upon me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
when I conceived the idea? And if at that
time, before it was known who it was who
had been so mysteriously murdered, I believed
my idea to be an inspiration, how much more
reason have I to believe it now that the
awful crime is brought so close to us and is
woven into your life? You declare that you
will bring your father&rsquo;s murderer to justice,
and you ask me to help you. What answer
can I make you? This. That all that a
woman&rsquo;s power, all that a woman&rsquo;s devotion,
all that a woman&rsquo;s self-sacrifice, can do to the
end to which you have pledged yourself, shall
be done by me. I can do much, more than
you can imagine possible, if certain thoughts,
created by what you have written, touch even
the border-land of truth. They do, I believe,
and they will lead me to the fulfilment of
what we both with all our hearts desire.</p>

<p>But you must be guided by me. For
once in the way, let a woman take the command,
and let her prove herself capable. Not
that you could not accomplish what is necessary
for our happiness, and in the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
truth and justice, a great deal better than I.
But your hands are not free; you cannot
move without the risk of being watched, and
persecuted, and hampered&mdash;while I am free to
act, without the slightest chance of being
suspected. I am comparatively unknown,
and can work without fear; besides, I am a
woman, and can do what you would scorn to
do. No man can be a match for such a
creature as Lydia Holdfast&mdash;let us call her by
that name. It must be a case of Greek meeting
Greek, and in me this woman will find
more than her match. So for the present do
not move openly; do not run the risk of
being discovered. Do nothing that will put
our enemies on their guard; above all, do not
write to the newspaper which published Lydia
Holdfast&rsquo;s infamous story; a friend has
already stepped forward in vindication of
your character, and that should be a comfort
to you, as it is to me. You are right in
saying that it will be best it should be
believed that you are dead; therefore, do
nothing rashly, but leave all to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>See, now&mdash;I am writing with so much confidence
and assurance that anyone who did
not know me would suppose I had a very
wise head on my shoulders. Well, it may not
be very wise, but it is clever and cunning, and
that is just what is wanted&mdash;cunning to meet
cunning. What is it Shakespeare says about
wearing your heart upon your sleeve? Not
for me; I will keep my heart hidden, where
only you can find it, and will wear in its
place something that will make me smile, or
pout, or cry&mdash;whichever will best serve my
turn.</p>

<p>You see, my dear, I am on the spot, and in
a position which gives me such immense
advantages. Your father has been cruelly
murdered&mdash;the discovery of the murderer
will lead to all the rest. There is in this house
a man who is in some way interested in the
mystery, who is living under an assumed
name, who paints and wears a wig, and who
endeavours to pass himself off as a foreigner.
I must find out who this Richard Manx really
is, and what is his motive in taking a room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at the very top of the house, and in presenting
himself here under a disguise. It is to
him I have traced the report that our house
and the next are haunted. He has a purpose
in spreading the report. Perhaps it is because
he does not wish the house to be let
until he has found what he is searching for in
the room in which your poor father was
killed. He might take it himself you say.
But would not this be to attract to himself an
amount of attention which would not be
agreeable to him? As to his being as poor
as he professes to be, I do not believe a word
of it. He has taken up his quarters here in
such a manner as to cause him to be but little
noticed, and it has been done with deliberate
intention.</p>

<p>I could say a hundred other things, my
mind is so crowded, but I have no time. I
shall not send this letter through the post.
Asleep in my bed is a trusty little friend,
who will faithfully carry out what I give her
to do. She will come to you, and you can
say whatever you please to her&mdash;give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
what message you like&mdash;and do not attempt
to employ her in any other way than in
bringing to me whatever you wish me to
receive. I myself have a very delicate piece
of work for her to do.</p>

<p>I long to see you, to embrace you, to comfort
you; but for a little while we must
remain apart. I cannot come to you, nor can
you come to me. We have too much at stake
to run the slightest risk. I propose to write
to you every night, and to send Fanny to you
every morning with my letters. You can give
her your letters to me. Do not send any more
strange men to the house. Richard Manx
might see them, and his suspicions might be
aroused. Perhaps the hardest duty before us
is the duty of patience, but unless we submit
we shall fail in our purpose. So let us be
brave and patient, working not for the
present, but for the future. My love, my
heart, are yours for ever, and I thank God
that I have such a man as you to love. If I
write in a more serious vein than I am accustomed
to do, it is because I recognise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
seriousness of the task upon which we are
engaged; it is not that I am altered; I could
not write lightly if I tried, and in your eyes
I would not be false.</p>

<p>I cannot say good-night. It is morning.
Well, to us sunrise is better than sunset.
Keep a stout heart, and do not despond&mdash;for
your own sake and mine. Farewell, dear
love, for a few hours.</p>
